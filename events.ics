 llege of Computing at Georgia Tech and Director of the GVU Center. His res
 earch interests focus primarily on driving human-centered concerns into co
 re computing infrastructure. He is a pioneer in the exploration of human-c
 entered perspectives on computer networking\, particularly in the home and
  has been active in developing more usable approaches to information secur
 ity systems. Lately\, his research has expanded into a number of explorati
 ons of the social impacts of computing technology\, and understanding how 
 technology can support the work of non-profits and NGOs. While he is a tec
 hnologist at heart\, he enjoys working with designers\, as well as ethnogr
 aphers and other social scientists.\n\nhttps://www.cc.gatech.edu/calendar/

DESCRIPTION:Free food\, freebies\n\nA Frontiers in Science Lecture to cele
 brate 2019\, the International Year of the Periodic Table\nFor more than h
 alf a century\, dedicated and eager groups of scientists have contrived wa
 ys to introduce heavier and heavier elements into the universe. Their effo
 rts finally completed the seventh row of the famous—if poorly understood
 —periodic table of the chemical elements.\nNow all 118 elements have nam
 es\, even though most spontaneously decay more quickly than you can say 
 “Oganesson” or “Livermorium.”\nWhat now? Continue? Try to start an
 other row? Why? To what end\, and at what cost?\nThis talk will explore th
 e economic\, societal\, and scientific benefits and drawbacks inherent in 
 this pursuit.\nAbout the Speaker\nMonica Halkais an experimental physicist
  whose research focused on the interaction of light with atoms.\nShe has c
 oauthored a set ofsix volumes on the periodic table\, which examines histo
 rical\, astrophysical\, and practical observations about each of the chemi
 cal elements.\nShe serves as associate director of theHonors Program at Ge
 orgia Tech\, where she teaches courses in optics\, energy science\, and th
 e nuclear age\, among others.\nAbout Frontiers in Science LecturesLectures
  in this series are intended to inform\, engage\, and inspire students\, f
 aculty\, staff\, and the public on developments\, breakthroughs\, and topi
 cs of general interest in the sciences and mathematics. Lecturers tailor t
 heir talks for nonexpert audiences.\nAbout the Periodic Table Frontiers in

DESCRIPTION:Free food\n\nIgor BargatinUniv. of Pennsylvania\, Mechanical E
 ngineering and Applied Mechanics\nAbstract: Recently\, we introduced the c
 oncept of plate mechanical metamaterials—cellular plates with carefully 
 controlled periodic geometry and unique mechanical properties—as well as
  its initial realization in the form of freestanding corrugated plates mad
 e out of an ultrathin film. We used atomic layer deposition (ALD) and micr
 ofabrication techniques to make robust plates out of a single continuous A
 LD layer with cm-scale lateral dimensions and thicknesses between 25 and 1
 00 nm\, creating the thinnest freestanding plates that can be picked up by
  hand. We also fabricated and characterized nanocardboard - plate metamate
 rials made from multiple layers of nanoscale thickness\, whose geometry an
 d properties are reminiscent of honeycomb sandwich plates or corrugated pa
 per cardboard. Ultralow weight\, mechanical robustness\, thermal insulatio
 n\, as well as chemical and thermal stability of alumina make plate metama
 terials attractive for numerous applications\, including structural elemen
 ts in flying microrobots and interstellar light sails\, high-temperature t
 hermal insulation in energy converters\, photophoretic levitation\, as wel
 l as ultrathin sensors and resonators. I will briefly discuss our experime
 ntal progress on all these applications\, including demonstrations of extr
 emely robust thermal insulators that can sustain a temperature difference 
 of ~1000 K across a micron-scale gap\, hollow AFM cantilevers that offer g
 reatly enhanced sensitivity and data acquisition rates\, and macroscopic p
 lates that levitate when illuminated by light.\nBio: Igor Bargatin receive
 d his undergraduate degree in theoretical physics from the Lomonosov Mosco
 w State University\, and a Ph.D. degree in physics and electrical engineer

DESCRIPTION:Free food\, freebies\n\nA Frontiers in Science Lecture to cele
 brate 2019\, the International Year of the Periodic Table\nIn 1997\, the J
 apanese oceanographerYoshiyuki Nozaki compiled a periodic table of ocean c
 hemistry\, encapsulating the distribution of elements as a function of dep
 th. In this periodic table\, many elements share similar patterns\, classi
 fied into just a few categories. The similarities indicate a common set of
  mechanisms behind the ocean cycling of elements.\nThe interaction of ocea
 n circulation\, chemistry\, and biology sets the distribution of elements 
 in the ocean. For example\, nonreactive elements are nearly uniformly dist
 ributed in the water column\, homogenized by ocean circulation and mixing.
 \nNutrient elements are depleted near the surface because of biological co
 nsumption and enriched in mid-depth due to decomposition of organic matter
 . Some trace metals – such as Fe\, Zn\, Ni\, and Cd – follow this patt
 ern. In contrast\, some heavy metals – like Al\, Mn\, Co\, and Pb – ar
 e subsumed into particles and removed from seawater.\nBuilding on the insi
 ghts from Nozaki’s periodic table\, this talk will interpret recent meas
 urements of changing seawater chemistry\, highlighting the importance of r
 ising carbon dioxide concentration in the air\, climate change\, and pollu
 tion of rivers and atmosphere.\nAbout the SpeakerTakamitsu “Taka” Itoi
 s an associate professor in the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences\,
  where he teaches physical and chemical oceanography. He received a Ph.D. 
 in Earth\, Atmospheric\, and Planetary Sciences in 2005 from Massachusetts
  Institute of Technology. His research has focused on the cycling of carbo
 n\, oxygen\, and iron in the global oceans\, using observations\, theory\,
  and computational modeling.\nAbout Frontiers in Science LecturesLectures 
 in this series are intended to inform\, engage\, and inspire students\, fa
 culty\, staff\, and the public on developments\, breakthroughs\, and topic
 s of general interest in the sciences and mathematics. Lecturers tailor th
 eir talks for nonexpert audiences.\nAbout the Periodic Table Frontiers in 
 Science Lecture SeriesThroughout 2019\, the College of Sciences will bring
  prominent researchers from Georgia Tech and beyond to expound on little-d
 iscussed aspects of chemical elements:\nFeb. 6\, James Sowell\, How the Un

DESCRIPTION:Free food\n\nSung Jin ParkAssistant Professor\, Coulter Depart

 o: My lab\, Biohybrid System Laboratory\, is interested in elucidating how
  biological systems coordinate the hierarchical structures and functions o
 f their individual components\, in order to produce emergent physical beha
 viors\, and how disrupting this coordination potentiates disease. We seek 
 to design\, build\, and test a hierarchy of biohybrid systems capable of r
 eproducing the targeted behaviors. Our primary interest is coordinated act
 ivation and contraction of tissue- and organ-level cardiac and skeletal mu
 scle systems. To pursue this goal\, we focus on the development of biohybr
 id fabrication methods and measurement systems through the combined applic
 ation of genetic tools\, induced pluripotent stem cells\, tissue engineeri

 ge) scaling has led to the shrinking of electronic systems over the last s
 everal decades. As scaling continues beyond CMOS to include advanced devic
 es\, scaling of the package needs to continue to enable system scaling\, l
 eading to the integration and miniaturization of systems. This requires ne
 w technologies for package integration which when connected to assembled I
 Cs leads to System on Package (SoP) solutions that have superior performan
 ce and size as compared to current technologies. This presentation will di
 scuss advanced SoP platforms for integration with a focus on heterogeneity
  for a variety of applications that include AI\, HPC\, Power Electronics\,
  mmWave to name a few. The inter-disciplinary nature of the research will 
 be highlighted based on faculty interactions between four different school

 igital Transformation of Last-Mile DeliveryDon Ratliff\nLast-mile delivery
  (i.e.\, the delivery of merchandise to a store or end user)\, is a prime 
 target for digital transformation. It is the most expensive and fastest gr
 owing leg of the supply chain and often the most critical to customer sati
 sfaction. Unfortunately\, it is also the most complex leg of the supply ch
 ain. We will discuss the delivery characteristics and trends that make dig
 ital transformation a necessity. We will also discuss the five stages of d
 igital transformation necessary to optimize delivery systems: 1. Data digi
 tization\; 2. Business intelligence\; 3. Predictive analytics\; 4. Automat
 ed delivery planning\; and Adaptive management. Finally\, we will examine 
 the advances in technology that enable transformation of last-mile deliver
 y.\nRegister Online for upcoming SCL IRC seminars\nAttendance to the sessi
 ons is complimentary for SCL corporate partners\, SCL Industry Advisory Bo

 nciscoAbstractThe eras of molecular biology and genomics have given us an 
 unprecedented picture of the molecular components underlying living system
 s. Nonetheless\, our understanding of how these components are assembled t
 o generate precision physiological systems remains far less developed. To 
 approach this problem\, we and others have been using synthetic biology me
 thods to empirically explore how molecular components can be used to const
 ruct novel cellular functions. Using these approaches\, we have shown that
  we can reprogram living cellular machines that carryout new novel precisi
 on functions\, including therapeutic immune cells that precisely recognize
  and eliminate cancer cells\, or cells that self-organize into tissues. By
  merging our understanding of cellular machines with our knowledge of our 
 bodies and its diseases\, we envision the development of a mature field of
  cell engineering with a toolbox of optimized molecular parts and circuit 
 architectures\, as well as disease and "GPS" sensors that allow the cell t
 o target specific sites in the body or brain. Such a platform will allow u
 s to rapidly and flexibly prototype and design cells that can identify sit
 es of disease or degeneration and execute precisely targeted and controlle
 d therapeutic actions.BiographyWendell Lim is the Byers Distinguished Prof
 essor and Chair of the Department of Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology a
 t the University of California San Francisco\, and an Investigator of the 
 Howard Hughes Medical Institute. He received his A.B. in Chemistry\, summa
  cum laude\, from Harvard College\, his Ph.D. in Biochemistry and Biophysi
 cs at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and completed his postdoct
 oral training at Yale University. His research focuses on the design princ
 iples of molecular circuits that govern cell decision-making and responses
 . His lab has made contributions in understanding the molecular machinery 
 of cell signaling and how molecular modules have been used in evolution to
  build novel new behaviors. Most recently he has been a pioneer in the eme
 rging field of synthetic biology\, exploring how these design principles c
 an be harnessed to engineer cells with customized therapeutic response pro
 grams. He is an author of the textbook\, Cell Signaling (Garland Science 2
 014) and was the founder of the cell therapy biotech startup\, Cell Design
  Labs\, which was acquired by Gilead Biosciences in 2017.A community lunch

 red human blood-brain barrier model for studying CNS delivery systems\nABS
 TRACTThe central nervous system (CNS) has a specialized vascular barrier\,
  the blood-brain barrier (BBB)\, which possesses a highly selective barrie
 r function that restricts the permeability of drugs\, leading to a high fa
 ilure rate in the development of CNS therapeutics. However\, it remains di
 fficult with existing in vivo models to conduct mechanistic studies of the
  barrier function and interactions with drugs at molecular and cellular le
 vels. This challenge highlights the importance of the development of in vi
 tro models that mimic the physiological structure and function of the BBB.
  Despite various efforts\, physiologically relevant in vitro human BBB mod
 els capable of highly precise\, quantitative analysis of drug delivery rem
 ain to be developed. In this study\, we present a human BBB-on-a-chip desi
 gned to create a 3D astrocytic network with reduced reactive gliosis and p
 olarized aquaporin-4\, critical features of the BBB that has yet to be dem
 onstrated. Our model will provide a reliable tool for studying the penetra
 nce of CNS drugs across the BBB.\nBIOSong Ih Ahn is a Ph.D. candidate in D
 r. YongTae Kim's lab at Georgia Institute of Technology. Before she starte
 d her Ph.D. in 2015\, she received her M.S. and B.S. in mechanical enginee
 ring from KAIST. Her research focuses on developing microengineered physio
 logical models for disease modeling and drug distribution study.\nRSVP for

DESCRIPTION:"Learning to Program Cellular Machines: Harnessing Cells to Tr
 eat Disease\, Build Tissues\, and Elucidate Design Principles"Wendell Lim\
 , Ph.D.Professor of Cellular and Molecular PharmacologyBiochemistry andBio
 physics and Pharmaceutical ChemistryInvestigator\, Howard Hughes Medical I
 nstitute Byers Distinguished ProfessorshipUniversity of California San Fra
 nciscoAbstractThe eras of molecular biology and genomics have given us an 
 unprecedented picture of the molecular components underlying living system
 s. Nonetheless\, our understanding of how these components are assembled t
 o generate precision physiological systems remains far less developed. To 
 approach this problem\, we and others have been using synthetic biology me
 thods to empirically explore how molecular components can be used to const
 ruct novel cellular functions. Using these approaches\, we have shown that
  we can reprogram living cellular machines that carryout new novel precisi
 on functions\, including therapeutic immune cells that precisely recognize
  and eliminate cancer cells\, or cells that self-organize into tissues. By
  merging our understanding of cellular machines with our knowledge of our 
 bodies and its diseases\, we envision the development of a mature field of
  cell engineering with a toolbox of optimized molecular parts and circuit 
 architectures\, as well as disease and "GPS" sensors that allow the cell t
 o target specific sites in the body or brain. Such a platform will allow u
 s to rapidly and flexibly prototype and design cells that can identify sit
 es of disease or degeneration and execute precisely targeted and controlle
 d therapeutic actions.BiographyWendell Lim is the Byers Distinguished Prof
 essor and Chair of the Department of Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology a
 t the University of California San Francisco\, and an Investigator of the 
 Howard Hughes Medical Institute. He received his A.B. in Chemistry\, summa
  cum laude\, from Harvard College\, his Ph.D. in Biochemistry and Biophysi
 cs at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and completed his postdoct
 oral training at Yale University. His research focuses on the design princ
 iples of molecular circuits that govern cell decision-making and responses
 . His lab has made contributions in understanding the molecular machinery 
 of cell signaling and how molecular modules have been used in evolution to
  build novel new behaviors. Most recently he has been a pioneer in the eme
 rging field of synthetic biology\, exploring how these design principles c
 an be harnessed to engineer cells with customized therapeutic response pro
 grams. He is an author of the textbook\, Cell Signaling (Garland Science 2
 014) and was the founder of the cell therapy biotech startup\, Cell Design
  Labs\, which was acquired by Gilead Biosciences in 2017.A community lunch
  will be served immediately following the presentation.\n\nhttps://www.bme
