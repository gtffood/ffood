 llege of Computing at Georgia Tech and Director of the GVU Center. His res
 earch interests focus primarily on driving human-centered concerns into co
 re computing infrastructure. He is a pioneer in the exploration of human-c
 entered perspectives on computer networking\, particularly in the home and
  has been active in developing more usable approaches to information secur
 ity systems. Lately\, his research has expanded into a number of explorati
 ons of the social impacts of computing technology\, and understanding how 
 technology can support the work of non-profits and NGOs. While he is a tec
 hnologist at heart\, he enjoys working with designers\, as well as ethnogr
 aphers and other social scientists.\n\nhttps://www.cc.gatech.edu/calendar/

DESCRIPTION:Free food\, freebies\n\nA Frontiers in Science Lecture to cele
 brate 2019\, the International Year of the Periodic Table\nFor more than h
 alf a century\, dedicated and eager groups of scientists have contrived wa
 ys to introduce heavier and heavier elements into the universe. Their effo
 rts finally completed the seventh row of the famous—if poorly understood
 —periodic table of the chemical elements.\nNow all 118 elements have nam
 es\, even though most spontaneously decay more quickly than you can say 
 “Oganesson” or “Livermorium.”\nWhat now? Continue? Try to start an
 other row? Why? To what end\, and at what cost?\nThis talk will explore th
 e economic\, societal\, and scientific benefits and drawbacks inherent in 
 this pursuit.\nAbout the Speaker\nMonica Halkais an experimental physicist
  whose research focused on the interaction of light with atoms.\nShe has c
 oauthored a set ofsix volumes on the periodic table\, which examines histo
 rical\, astrophysical\, and practical observations about each of the chemi
 cal elements.\nShe serves as associate director of theHonors Program at Ge
 orgia Tech\, where she teaches courses in optics\, energy science\, and th
 e nuclear age\, among others.\nAbout Frontiers in Science LecturesLectures
  in this series are intended to inform\, engage\, and inspire students\, f
 aculty\, staff\, and the public on developments\, breakthroughs\, and topi
 cs of general interest in the sciences and mathematics. Lecturers tailor t
 heir talks for nonexpert audiences.\nAbout the Periodic Table Frontiers in

DESCRIPTION:Free food\n\nIgor BargatinUniv. of Pennsylvania\, Mechanical E
 ngineering and Applied Mechanics\nAbstract: Recently\, we introduced the c
 oncept of plate mechanical metamaterials—cellular plates with carefully 
 controlled periodic geometry and unique mechanical properties—as well as
  its initial realization in the form of freestanding corrugated plates mad
 e out of an ultrathin film. We used atomic layer deposition (ALD) and micr
 ofabrication techniques to make robust plates out of a single continuous A
 LD layer with cm-scale lateral dimensions and thicknesses between 25 and 1
 00 nm\, creating the thinnest freestanding plates that can be picked up by
  hand. We also fabricated and characterized nanocardboard - plate metamate
 rials made from multiple layers of nanoscale thickness\, whose geometry an
 d properties are reminiscent of honeycomb sandwich plates or corrugated pa

 n\, as well as chemical and thermal stability of alumina make plate metama

 ntal progress on all these applications\, including demonstrations of extr
 emely robust thermal insulators that can sustain a temperature difference 
 of ~1000 K across a micron-scale gap\, hollow AFM cantilevers that offer g
 reatly enhanced sensitivity and data acquisition rates\, and macroscopic p

DESCRIPTION:Free food\, freebies\n\nA Frontiers in Science Lecture to cele
 brate 2019\, the International Year of the Periodic Table\nIn 1997\, the J
 apanese oceanographerYoshiyuki Nozaki compiled a periodic table of ocean c
 hemistry\, encapsulating the distribution of elements as a function of dep
 th. In this periodic table\, many elements share similar patterns\, classi
 fied into just a few categories. The similarities indicate a common set of
  mechanisms behind the ocean cycling of elements.\nThe interaction of ocea
 n circulation\, chemistry\, and biology sets the distribution of elements 
 in the ocean. For example\, nonreactive elements are nearly uniformly dist
 ributed in the water column\, homogenized by ocean circulation and mixing.
 \nNutrient elements are depleted near the surface because of biological co
 nsumption and enriched in mid-depth due to decomposition of organic matter
 . Some trace metals – such as Fe\, Zn\, Ni\, and Cd – follow this patt
 ern. In contrast\, some heavy metals – like Al\, Mn\, Co\, and Pb – ar
 e subsumed into particles and removed from seawater.\nBuilding on the insi
 ghts from Nozaki’s periodic table\, this talk will interpret recent meas
 urements of changing seawater chemistry\, highlighting the importance of r
 ising carbon dioxide concentration in the air\, climate change\, and pollu
 tion of rivers and atmosphere.\nAbout the SpeakerTakamitsu “Taka” Itoi
 s an associate professor in the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences\,
  where he teaches physical and chemical oceanography. He received a Ph.D. 
 in Earth\, Atmospheric\, and Planetary Sciences in 2005 from Massachusetts
  Institute of Technology. His research has focused on the cycling of carbo
 n\, oxygen\, and iron in the global oceans\, using observations\, theory\,
  and computational modeling.\nAbout Frontiers in Science LecturesLectures 
 in this series are intended to inform\, engage\, and inspire students\, fa
 culty\, staff\, and the public on developments\, breakthroughs\, and topic
 s of general interest in the sciences and mathematics. Lecturers tailor th
 eir talks for nonexpert audiences.\nAbout the Periodic Table Frontiers in 
 Science Lecture SeriesThroughout 2019\, the College of Sciences will bring

 o: My lab\, Biohybrid System Laboratory\, is interested in elucidating how
  biological systems coordinate the hierarchical structures and functions o
 f their individual components\, in order to produce emergent physical beha
 viors\, and how disrupting this coordination potentiates disease. We seek 
 to design\, build\, and test a hierarchy of biohybrid systems capable of r
 eproducing the targeted behaviors. Our primary interest is coordinated act
 ivation and contraction of tissue- and organ-level cardiac and skeletal mu
 scle systems. To pursue this goal\, we focus on the development of biohybr
 id fabrication methods and measurement systems through the combined applic
 ation of genetic tools\, induced pluripotent stem cells\, tissue engineeri
 ng\, microfabrication\, electronics\, optics\, and feedback control. The r
 esulting findings and technical developments will be translated into vario
 us applications such as (1) stem cell-based functional assays for personal
 ized disease diagnosis and treatment and (2) new types of biohybrid actuat
 ors for creating biological autonomous systems.\n\nhttps://calendar.gatech

 ge) scaling has led to the shrinking of electronic systems over the last s
 everal decades. As scaling continues beyond CMOS to include advanced devic
 es\, scaling of the package needs to continue to enable system scaling\, l
 eading to the integration and miniaturization of systems. This requires ne
 w technologies for package integration which when connected to assembled I
 Cs leads to System on Package (SoP) solutions that have superior performan
 ce and size as compared to current technologies. This presentation will di
 scuss advanced SoP platforms for integration with a focus on heterogeneity
  for a variety of applications that include AI\, HPC\, Power Electronics\,
  mmWave to name a few. The inter-disciplinary nature of the research will 
 be highlighted based on faculty interactions between four different school

 igital Transformation of Last-Mile DeliveryDon Ratliff\nLast-mile delivery
  (i.e.\, the delivery of merchandise to a store or end user)\, is a prime 
 target for digital transformation. It is the most expensive and fastest gr
 owing leg of the supply chain and often the most critical to customer sati
 sfaction. Unfortunately\, it is also the most complex leg of the supply ch
 ain. We will discuss the delivery characteristics and trends that make dig
 ital transformation a necessity. We will also discuss the five stages of d
 igital transformation necessary to optimize delivery systems: 1. Data digi
 tization\; 2. Business intelligence\; 3. Predictive analytics\; 4. Automat
 ed delivery planning\; and Adaptive management. Finally\, we will examine 
 the advances in technology that enable transformation of last-mile deliver
 y.\nRegister Online for upcoming SCL IRC seminars\nAttendance to the sessi
 ons is complimentary for SCL corporate partners\, SCL Industry Advisory Bo
 ard members\, SCL affiliated faculty and students\, and students enrolled 
 in the Masters in Supply Chain Engineering program.\nTo take advantage of 
 the included lunch\, you must register by deadline noted on the registrati

 to increase awareness of the impact of implicit bias and facilitate equita
 ble decision-making across myriad processes related to faculty evaluations
 . As a participant in the workshop\, you will learn the following:\n• An
  introduction to the concept of implicit bias and how these unconscious\, 
 automatic mental processes may impact behaviors such as evaluating candida
 tes during faculty search and/or RPT processes.\n• Empirical research on
  vitaes\, letters of recommendations\, and teaching evaluations to illustr
 ate the impact of implicit bias on decisions.\n• Effective practices and
  strategies for faculty search and RPT committees.\nThese workshops will b

 nciscoAbstractThe eras of molecular biology and genomics have given us an 
 unprecedented picture of the molecular components underlying living system
 s. Nonetheless\, our understanding of how these components are assembled t
 o generate precision physiological systems remains far less developed. To 
 approach this problem\, we and others have been using synthetic biology me
 thods to empirically explore how molecular components can be used to const
 ruct novel cellular functions. Using these approaches\, we have shown that
  we can reprogram living cellular machines that carryout new novel precisi
 on functions\, including therapeutic immune cells that precisely recognize
  and eliminate cancer cells\, or cells that self-organize into tissues. By
  merging our understanding of cellular machines with our knowledge of our 
 bodies and its diseases\, we envision the development of a mature field of
  cell engineering with a toolbox of optimized molecular parts and circuit 
 architectures\, as well as disease and "GPS" sensors that allow the cell t
 o target specific sites in the body or brain. Such a platform will allow u
 s to rapidly and flexibly prototype and design cells that can identify sit
 es of disease or degeneration and execute precisely targeted and controlle
 d therapeutic actions.BiographyWendell Lim is the Byers Distinguished Prof
 essor and Chair of the Department of Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology a
 t the University of California San Francisco\, and an Investigator of the 
 Howard Hughes Medical Institute. He received his A.B. in Chemistry\, summa
  cum laude\, from Harvard College\, his Ph.D. in Biochemistry and Biophysi
 cs at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and completed his postdoct
 oral training at Yale University. His research focuses on the design princ
 iples of molecular circuits that govern cell decision-making and responses
 . His lab has made contributions in understanding the molecular machinery 
 of cell signaling and how molecular modules have been used in evolution to
  build novel new behaviors. Most recently he has been a pioneer in the eme
 rging field of synthetic biology\, exploring how these design principles c
 an be harnessed to engineer cells with customized therapeutic response pro

 red human blood-brain barrier model for studying CNS delivery systems\nABS
 TRACTThe central nervous system (CNS) has a specialized vascular barrier\,
  the blood-brain barrier (BBB)\, which possesses a highly selective barrie
 r function that restricts the permeability of drugs\, leading to a high fa
 ilure rate in the development of CNS therapeutics. However\, it remains di
 fficult with existing in vivo models to conduct mechanistic studies of the
  barrier function and interactions with drugs at molecular and cellular le
 vels. This challenge highlights the importance of the development of in vi
 tro models that mimic the physiological structure and function of the BBB.
  Despite various efforts\, physiologically relevant in vitro human BBB mod
 els capable of highly precise\, quantitative analysis of drug delivery rem
 ain to be developed. In this study\, we present a human BBB-on-a-chip desi
 gned to create a 3D astrocytic network with reduced reactive gliosis and p
 olarized aquaporin-4\, critical features of the BBB that has yet to be dem
 onstrated. Our model will provide a reliable tool for studying the penetra
 nce of CNS drugs across the BBB.\nBIOSong Ih Ahn is a Ph.D. candidate in D
 r. YongTae Kim's lab at Georgia Institute of Technology. Before she starte
 d her Ph.D. in 2015\, she received her M.S. and B.S. in mechanical enginee
 ring from KAIST. Her research focuses on developing microengineered physio
 logical models for disease modeling and drug distribution study.\nRSVP for

DESCRIPTION:"Learning to Program Cellular Machines: Harnessing Cells to Tr
 eat Disease\, Build Tissues\, and Elucidate Design Principles"Wendell Lim\
 , Ph.D.Professor of Cellular and Molecular PharmacologyBiochemistry andBio
 physics and Pharmaceutical ChemistryInvestigator\, Howard Hughes Medical I
 nstitute Byers Distinguished ProfessorshipUniversity of California San Fra
 nciscoAbstractThe eras of molecular biology and genomics have given us an 
 unprecedented picture of the molecular components underlying living system
 s. Nonetheless\, our understanding of how these components are assembled t
 o generate precision physiological systems remains far less developed. To 
 approach this problem\, we and others have been using synthetic biology me
 thods to empirically explore how molecular components can be used to const
 ruct novel cellular functions. Using these approaches\, we have shown that
  we can reprogram living cellular machines that carryout new novel precisi
 on functions\, including therapeutic immune cells that precisely recognize
  and eliminate cancer cells\, or cells that self-organize into tissues. By
  merging our understanding of cellular machines with our knowledge of our 
 bodies and its diseases\, we envision the development of a mature field of
  cell engineering with a toolbox of optimized molecular parts and circuit 
 architectures\, as well as disease and "GPS" sensors that allow the cell t
 o target specific sites in the body or brain. Such a platform will allow u
 s to rapidly and flexibly prototype and design cells that can identify sit
 es of disease or degeneration and execute precisely targeted and controlle
 d therapeutic actions.BiographyWendell Lim is the Byers Distinguished Prof
 essor and Chair of the Department of Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology a
 t the University of California San Francisco\, and an Investigator of the 
 Howard Hughes Medical Institute. He received his A.B. in Chemistry\, summa
  cum laude\, from Harvard College\, his Ph.D. in Biochemistry and Biophysi
 cs at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and completed his postdoct
 oral training at Yale University. His research focuses on the design princ
 iples of molecular circuits that govern cell decision-making and responses
 . His lab has made contributions in understanding the molecular machinery 
 of cell signaling and how molecular modules have been used in evolution to
  build novel new behaviors. Most recently he has been a pioneer in the eme
 rging field of synthetic biology\, exploring how these design principles c
 an be harnessed to engineer cells with customized therapeutic response pro
 grams. He is an author of the textbook\, Cell Signaling (Garland Science 2

DESCRIPTION:Free food\n\nAbstract:\nWe have witnessed tremendous growth in
  Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) recently. However\
 , research shows that AI and ML models are often vulnerable to adversarial
  attacks\, and their predictions can be difficult to understand\, evaluate
  and ultimately act upon.\nDiscovering real-world vulnerabilities of deep 
 neural networks and countermeasures to mitigate such threats has become es
 sential to successful deployment of AI in security settings. We present ou
 r joint works with Intel which include the first targeted physical adversa
 rial attack (ShapeShifter) that fools state-of-the-art object detectors\; 
 a fast defense (SHIELD) that removes digital adversarial noise by stochast
 ic data compression\; and interactive systems (ADAGIO and MLsploit) that f
 urther democratize the study of adversarial machine learning and facilitat
 e real-time experimentation for deep learning practitioners.\nFinally\, we
  also present how scalable interactive visualization can be used to amplif
 y people’s ability to understand and interact with large-scale data and 
 complex models. We sample from projects where interactive visualization ha
 s provided key leaps of insight\, from increased model interpretability (G
 amut with Microsoft Research)\, to model explorability with models trained
  on millions of instances (ActiVis deployed with Facebook)\, increased usa
 bility for non-experts about state-of-the-art AI (GAN Lab open-sourced wit
 h Google Brain\; went viral!)\, and our latest work Summit\, an interactiv
 e system that scalably summarizes and visualizes what features a deep lear
 ning model has learned and how those features interact to make predictions
 . We conclude by highlighting the next visual analytics research frontiers
  in AI.\nSpeaker Bio:\nPoloChauis an Associate Professor of Computing at G
 eorgia Tech. He co-directs Georgia Tech's MS Analytics program. His resear
 ch group bridges machine learning and visualization to synthesize scalable
  interactive tools for making sense of massive datasets\, interpreting com
 plex AI models\, and solving real world problems in cybersecurity\, human-
 centered AI\, graph visualization and mining\, and social good. His Ph.D.

 cation Scientist\, Fluidigm Mass Cytometry\nHigh-dimensional single-cell a
 nalysis has become critical to basic and clinical research. In traditional
  flow cytometry\, the spectral overlap between fluorophores requires compl
 icated data compensation and limits the number of markers measured\, thus 
 creating speed\, labor and reproducibility bottlenecks. Mass Cytometry ove
 rcomes these limitations by utilizing antibodies labelled with rare earth 
 metals. 2019 has been the most active year yet in the mass cytometry commu
 nity with over 200 publications to date. CyTOF® technology has also been 
 adopted by multiple consortia and in more than 40 clinical trials.The Heli
 os™\, a CyTOF® system permits the analysis of 37+ unique targets on a p
 er-cell basis enabling unparalleled insight into the phenotype and functio
 n of cell populations from normal and diseased states in a single tube. Ad
 ditionally\, barcoding for Mass Cytometry allows combining up to 20 sample
 s in one tube for increased efficiency and to eliminate sample to sample v
 ariation.In this seminar\, we will describe the workflow for the Helios™
  system\, how to get started with your own mass cytometry experiments\, an

 . Stebner\,Rowlinson Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Mat
 erials Science\,Colorado School of Mines\nAbstract\nThe Alliance for the D
 evelopment of Additive Processing Technologies (ADAPT) is developing a com
 bined physics – machine learning platform for assessing Process-Structur
 e-Property relationships in metals additive manufacturing. An added benefi
 t of this approach is the inherent statistical core of the models – the 
 AI platform is not only capable of learning the PSP relations of AM\, but 
 also providing statistical reports on part quality and variation in a mann
 er conducive to certification. In this presentation\, it will be shown how
  such a framework can be used to optimize parts\, processes\, and material
 s for metals additive manufacturing\, resulting in reduced times and costs
  for qualifications. The parts example will cover accelerated qualificatio
 n of a 17-4 Stainless Steel door hinge for an Army ground vehicle. The mat
 erials example will document ways and means to make laser powder bed fusio
 n manufactured Inconel 718 stronger & more ductile than wrought material. 
 The processes example will show how machine learning can be used to determ
 ine the parameters for a new printer that has a more powerful laser than p
 revious generations of machines\, with verification carried out in printin
 g Ti-64 coupons. These examples will be motivated with a vision for how ne
 tworks of 3D printers that share a common database can shift paradigms in 
 manufacturing.\nBiography\nAaron is the Rowlinson Associate Professor of M
 echanical Engineering and Materials Science at the Colorado School of Mine
 s\, as well as the Executive Director of the Alliance for the Development 
 of Additive Processing Technologies (ADAPT)\, a 22-member academic-industr

DESCRIPTION:Free food\n\nAbstract:\nAll modern public elections in the Uni
 ted States use computers called voting machines to automate at least part 
 of the voting process. Like all computers\, voting machines can be misprog
 rammed\, misconfigured\, misused and hacked. Poorly secured data\, open ne
 tworks\, and aging computing equipment with known vulnerabilities to malwa
 re are all subject to attack. There is substantial evidence that foreign a
 dversaries have infiltrated American election systems and there is growing
  evidence that election results were affected. Federal agencies\, the Inte
 lligence Community\, and congressional committees all agree that action is
  required. This talk will focus on the unique aspects of elections from a 
 computing standpoint: (1) Why are there not national standards? (2) What c
 ybersecurity tools would make elections more secure? (3) How does the righ
 t to a secret ballot affect election technology? (4) What is the future of
  electronic voting in the state of Georgia?\nIn this talk I will pay speci
 al attention to usability and privacy problems and point out areas in whic
 h improved understanding of cognitive limitations of voters can influence 
 public policy. This work is based in part on a recent paper entitled “Ba
 llot Marking Devices (BMDs) cannot assure the will of the voters\,” by P
 hilip Stark\, Andrew Appel\, and me. This paper can be downloaded here:htt

DESCRIPTION:Free food\, freebies\n\nA Frontiers in Science Lecture to cele
 brate 2019\, the International Year of the Periodic Table\nThe Cold War ri
 valry between the United States and the Soviet Union lasted for much of th
 e second half of the 20th century. While the superpowers never engaged dir
 ectly in full-scale armed combat\, a nuclear arms race became the centerpi
 ece of a doctrine of mutually assured destruction\,and prompted a mass pro
 duction of plutonium\, and the designing\, building\, and testing of large
  numbers of nuclear weapons.\nIn more than 50 years of operation\, the Col
 d War battlefields created over 100 metric tons of plutonium\, produced te
 ns of thousands of nuclear warheads\, oversaw more than 1000 detonations\,
  and left behind a legacy of contaminated facilities\, soils\, and ground 
 water.\nThe extent of long-term adverse health effects will depend on the 
 mobility of plutonium and other actinides in the environment and on our ab
 ility to develop cost-effective scientific methods of removing or isolatin
 g actinides from the environment. Studying the complex chemistry of pluton
 ium and the actinides in the environment is one of the most important tech
 nological challenges\, and one of the greatest scientific challenges in ac
 tinide science today.\nDavid L. Clark will summarize our current understan
 ding of actinide chemistry in the environment\, and how that understanding
  was used in the decontamination and decommissioning of the Rocky Flats Si
 te\, where plutonium triggers for U.S. nuclear weapons were manufactured. 
 At Rocky Flats\, synchrotron radiation measurements made at the Stanford S
 ynchrotron Radiation Laboratory were developed into a science-based decisi
 on-making tool that saved billions of dollars by focusing site-directed ef
 forts in the correct areas\, and aided the most extensive cleanup in the h
 istory of Superfund legislation to finish one year ahead of schedule\, ult
 imately resulting in billions of dollars in taxpayer savings. (LA-UR-15-22
 406)\nAbout the Speaker\nDavid L. Clark is a Los Alamos National Laborator
 y (LANL) Fellow and Director of the Laboratory’s National Security Educa
 tion Center. He received a B.S. in chemistry in 1982 from the University o
 f Washington\, and a Ph.D. in 1986 from Indiana University.\nClark was a p
 ostdoctoral fellow at the University of Oxford before joining Los Alamos N
 ational Laboratory as a J. Robert Oppenheimer Fellow in 1988. He became a 
 Technical Staff Member in the Isotope and Nuclear Chemistry Division in 19
 89. Since then he has held various leadership positions at Los Alamos\, in
 cluding PI for the Laboratory’s BES Heavy Element Chemistry program (199
 3 – 2014)\, Solubility Task for the Yucca Mountain Project (1993-1997)\,
  Source Term Test Program for the WIPP license application (1996-1997)\, p
 rogram manager for plutonium aging and pit lifetime assessments\, (1998-20
 03)\, and Capture Manager for the Plutonium Science and Research Strategy 
 (2009 – 2019).\nClark has been highly involved in service to the actinid
 e chemistry community through organization of ACS symposia (1993-present)\
 , service on organizing and steering committees of 3 international actinid
 e conferences including Actinides (1993-present)\, Migration (2003 – pre
 sent)\, and Plutonium Futures – the Science (1997-present)\; the establi
 shment and stewardship of the Seaborg Institute at Los Alamos (1997-2009)\
 ; the development of the Plutonium Science and Research Strategy (2009-pre
 sent)\; and much more.\nHe has served the DOE as a technical advisor for e
 nvironmental stewardship including the Rocky Flats cleanup and closure (19
 95-2005)\, closure of High-Level Waste tanks at the Savannah River Site (2
 011)\, and as a technical advisor to the DOE High Level Waste Corporate Bo
 ard (2009-2011).\nHe is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advan
 cement of Science\, and a Los Alamos Laboratory Fellow. He is the recipien
 t of two ACS national awards - the Nobel Laureate Signature Award (1988) a
 nd the Glenn Seaborg Award in Nuclear Chemistry (2017). He has also been h
 onored with several Defense Programs Awards of Excellence\, the most notab
 le in 2006 for his work on pit lifetime assessments for the nation.\nHis r
 esearch interests are in the molecular and electronic structure of actinid
 e materials\, applications of synchrotron radiation to nuclear security\, 
 behavior of actinide and fission products in the environment\, the aging e
 ffects of nuclear weapons materials\, and the education of judges on the m
 ethods of science.\nHe is an international authority on the chemistry and 
 physics of the actinides\, and has published over 175 peer-reviewed public
 ations\, encyclopedia and book chapters.\nAbout Frontiers in Science Lectu

 ESSION OVERVIEW\nThe Hunter River region on Australia’s east coast is ho
 me to the world’s largest coal export operation. More tons of coal are e
 xported each year from the port of Newcastle\, at the mouth of the Hunter 
 River\, than from any other port in the world. Coal exported is mined by m
 ore than 10 competing producers operating upward of 40 mines\, but uses sh
 ared infrastructure to reach the port\, be blended into final products hel
 d in stockyards and loaded onto vessels at berth. The shared infrastructur
 e\, which consists of rail lines\, trains\, stockyards\, stockpile stackin
 g and reclaiming machinery\, berths\, vessel loading machinery\, the river
  channel and tug boats\, is owned and/or operated by several different org
 anizations. All of these organizations must coordinate their activities so
  as to deliver coal in an effective and efficient way. In this talk\, we w
 ill discuss how collaboration between the many stakeholders has been shape
 d and evolved\, how collaboration has been essential to the delivery of pr
 oductivity gains in this complex logistics system\, and will touch on the 
 critical role analytics and the tools of operations research have played.

DESCRIPTION:Free food\n\nProf. Blair Brettmann - School of Chemical and Bi
 omolecular Engineering\, School of Materials Science and Engineering\, Geo
 rgia Institute of Technology\nAbstract: Electrospinning is a valuable prod
 uction method for nanoscale polymeric fibers. However\, a major limitation
  of the technology is the requirement for the use of high molecular weight
  polymers as a major part of the matrix. Many applications would benefit f
 rom a more expansive range in the materials able to be electrospun\, inclu
 ding pharmaceuticals\, wearable devices and diagnostics\, and active filtr
 ation. In order to realize these more advanced functional materials\, comp
 osites of polymers and particles must be developed and a strong understand
 ing of how particle inclusion affects the electrospinning process and mat 
 properties is essential. In this work\, we examine material systems contai
 ning various polymers and active particles\, focusing on how inclusion of 
 particles affects electrospinnability and functionality of the fibrous mat
 . We have found that polymer solutions with high conductivity\, hence narr
 ow fiber diameters\, tend to trap particles in a web-like structure\, rath
 er than within individual fibers. Other polymer-particle systems exhibit a
  ‘bunches of grapes’ morphology where the particles agglomerate yet th
 e polymer matrix still surrounds them and connects the bunches with fibers
 . These interesting morphologies can be explained by conductivity\, rheolo
 gy\, and particle interactions in the polymer solution. We also examine ho
 w particle inclusion affects the viscoelasticity of the solutions and tie 
 this to the electrospinning process window\; showing that a finite window 
 of viscoelasticity yields optimal electrospinnability. We use these fundam
 ental results to electrospin materials for advanced functional application
 s such as pharmaceuticals and conducting polymers and provide outlook for 
 further work in increasing the range of materials that are electrospinnabl

 to create remarkable and varied works of art. She will lead a conversation
  with three of the eleven artists included in the exhibit\, discussing ins
 piration\, technique\, and experiences.\nThroughout Samuel Stabler’s car

DESCRIPTION:Free food\n\nAbstract:\nPlaydate — a tiny\, yellow\, handhel
 d game console — made a bigger splash than its creators envisioned when 
 it was announced this past May. Relying on a combination of old tech (a 1-
 bit black-and-white display)\, new design (from Sweden’s renowned Teenag
 e Engineering) and some just-plain-weird ideas (a side-mounted crank as a 
 game controller)\, software maker Panic Inc. hopes that Playdate can carve
  itself a niche in a video game marketplace where giants dominate. The sto
 ry is still in-progress — Playdate won’t be released until next year 
 — but Greg Maletic\, Panic’s Director of Special Projects\, will give 
 you an insider’s peek at the decisions that have driven Playdate’s con
 ception\, design\, manufacture\, and marketing.\nSpeaker Bio:\nGreg Maleti
 c has had a varied career that includes software development\, theme park 
 design\, and consumer electronics. Maletic currently is the Director of Sp
 ecial Projects at Panic Inc.\, where he leads a small team developing Play
 date\, a new handheld video game console shipping in 2020. Prior to Panic\
 , Greg worked with Walt Disney Imagineering\, developing attraction concep
 ts and drawing illustrations for use in Disney theme parks. In 2007\, Male
 tic combined his love of film with his overwhelming interest in games and 
 technology\, releasing the documentary TILT: The Battle to Save Pinball. T
 ILT chronicles the development of “Pinball 2000”\, Bally/Williams last
 -ditch effort to save the dying pinball industry. Maletic’s early work e
 xperience is in software development and marketing\, first at Apple as a p
 roduct manager for MacOS\, later as a co-founder of Zero G Software\, a so
 ftware tools maker sold to Macrovision in 2005.\nSchedule of Brown Bag Spe

 ELearning the Koopman Operator for Dynamic DataABSTRACT\nRecent work in th
 e study of dynamic systems has focussed on data-driven decomposition techn
 iques that approximate the action of the Koopman operator on observable fu
 nctions of the underlying phenomena.\nIn particular\, the data-driven meth
 od of dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) has been explored\, with multiple v
 ariants of the algorithm in existence\, including extended DMD\, DMD in re
 producing kernel Hilbert spaces\, a Bayesian framework\, a variant for sto
 chastic dynamical systems\, and a variant that uses deep neural networks.I
 n this talk\, I shall briefly summarize the large existing work ondata-dri
 ven learning of Koopman operator models\, and then describe new sampling-b
 ased sketching approaches (SketchyCoreSVD\, SketchyCoreTucker) together wi
 th matrix-valued Kernels\, to achieve accelerated Koopman operator approxi
 mations of dynamic observable data. Examples are drawn from remote sensing
  and FTIR hyperspectral tensor images\, bio-medical cardiac magnetic reson
 ance video\, and time series reactive flow simulations of a single ejector
  combustion process.\nBIOChandrajit Bajaj is the Computational Applied Mat
 hematics Chair in Visualization\, professor of computer science\, and dire
 ctor of the Center for Computational Visualization at the University of Te
 xas at Austin. Bajaj earned his undergraduate degree in electrical enginee
 ring from the Indian Institute of Technology\, and his master's and Ph.D. 
 in computer science from Cornell University. He is an IEEE\, ACM\, and AAA

DESCRIPTION:Free food\n\nHosted by the Energy Club\nAdam Barkley\, Solutio
 ns Architect in the Power Electronics Systems R&D team at Wolfspeed\, will
  be presenting an overview of recent advances in Silicon Carbide (SiC) MOS
 FET power semiconductor devices and packaging technology. The talk will pr
 ovide a short introduction to Wolfspeed\, some history of the evolution of
  SiC power devices over the last 20+ years\, and insight into how this wid
 e bandgap technology is enabling many of today’s power electronics appli
 cations ranging from renewable energy to electric vehicles.  Several of th
 e key electrical characteristics of the SiC MOSFET will be reviewed and co
 mpared to competing Silicon power semiconductor devices. Significant focus
  will be placed on the system-level benefits achievable when utilizing thi
 s technology\; generally some combination of improved energy efficiency\, 
 smaller size\, and lighter weight. Next\, several medium voltage (3.3kV to
  10kV) MOSFET devices will be presented which promise some radical new pos
 sibilities in the grid-connected power electronics and renewable energy sp
 aces. Finally\, Adam will discuss theCree| Wolfspeed internship program an
 d encourage participation in the Career Fair. Questions and interactivity 
 are highly encouraged throughout the talk.\n\nhttps://calendar.gatech.edu/

DESCRIPTION:Free food\n\nMicro-Physiological System Seminar Series—Micro
 fluidic and International Research Collaboration\nMicrofluidics & Internat
 ional Research Collaborations --Shuichi TakayamaThis seminars-plus-lunch p
 rogram aims to catalyze scientific and cultural exchange between Georgia T
 ech students and 12 visiting undergrads from Japan. It will also provide G
 aTech students a brief preview of a planned international exchange program
  for summer 2020 and beyond. My presentation will start with description o
 f an interesting microfluidic phenomenon and its application to microfluid
 ic sperm sorting used for in vitro fertilization. This was an internationa
 l industry-academia collaboration that led to an FDA-cleared medical devic
 e that is used clinically. The presentation will also describe a computer-
 controlled microfluidic pumping technology that was developed by an underg
 raduate student\, then applied to biomedical needs such as microfluidic em
 bryo culture\, another device that has been tested clinically. A final mic
 rofluidic topic will be efforts\, including work by Ga Tech Undergrads\, t
 o construct microscale intestine models with human intestinal organoids an
 d a microbiome.\nThe presentation will also give a short preview of two co
 mponents of the planned exchange program:(i) Mentoring opportunity for GRA
 DUATE STUDENTS to host a Japanese Undergrad Researcher for ~5 weeks in Aug
 /Sept 2020. Mentors will be invited to cultural exchange programs and also
  receive $3000 to be used for travel to scientific conferences or material
 s and supplies for the lab.(ii) Another component is an opportunity for Ge
 orgia Tech BME UNDERGRADS to do a fully-sponsored Global Internship Progra
 m(GIP) in Japan in summer 2020 (mid May - July) doing research at leading 
 Japanese Universities.\nUltrafast microfluidic cell compression for convec
 tive intracellular macromolecule delivery--Anna Liu Efficient intracellula
 r delivery of target macromolecules remains a major obstacle in cell engin
 eering\, cell labeling\, and other biomedical applications. Our lab has di
 scovered the unique cell biophysical phenomenon of convective intracellula
 r macromolecule delivery using mechanically induced\, transient cell volum
 e exchange. Ultrafast microfluidic cell compressions are used to cause bri
 ef\, deformation­induced cell volume loss followed by volume recovery thr
 ough uptake of surrounding fluid. Macromolecules suspended in the surround
 ing fluid enter the cell on convective fluid currents. We harness this cel
 l volume exchange behavior for high-throughput\, convective intracellular 
 delivery of large macromolecules\, including plasmids (>10 kb) and particl
 es (>30 nm)\, while maintaining high cell viability (>95%). Successful exp
 eriments in transfection and intracellular labeling demonstrate potential 
 to overcome the most prohibitive challenges in intracellular delivery for 
 cell engineering.\nInvestigating health effects of aerosol particles on si
 ngle-cells in a high-throughput air-liquid interface platform --Jenni Li A
 ir pollution and its detrimental health effects have been an increasingly 
 alarming concern for the world. Cardiovascular diseases\, chronic respirat
 ory diseases\, and different types of cancers can all be linked to air pol
 lution effects. Furthermore\, over 4 million people die per year from the 
 direct effects of ambient particulate matter. One conventional method for 
 studying the health effects of aerosol particles is to collect particulate
  matter (PM) from the atmosphere\, resuspend the PM in cell culture media\
 , add the PM/media to cell cultures\, and assess single cell oxidative str
 ess. However\, this method does not resemble the in vivo conditions of alv
 eolar macrophages. Alveolar macrophages are found in the alveoli of the lu
 ngs where the oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange between blood and air tak
 es place and are a key cell type that is affected by PM. In this project\,
  we aim to create a microfluidic air-liquid interface environment that mim
 ics how alveolar macrophages are exposed to PM in order to study effects o
 f PM at a single-cell level. Utilizing a microfluidic platform provides un
 iform microenvironment and enables high-throughput and high content single
 -cell analysis for hundreds of cells. We adapted a previously developed mi
 crofluidic single-cell analysis technology and developed a method for expo
 sing cells to an air-liquid interface. We then characterized cells by micr
 oscopy and LIVE/DEAD staining to assess if cells remain viable during air 
 exposure. Following this validation of the air-liquid interface platform\,
  we will use it to study the single cell responses of intracellular reacti
 ve oxygen species in exposure to aerosol particles.\nPlease RSVP at:  http
