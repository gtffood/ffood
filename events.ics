DESCRIPTION:Status: unknown\n\n"Learning to Program Cellular Machines: Har
 nessing Cells to Treat Disease\, Build Tissues\, and Elucidate Design Prin
 ciples"\n\nWendell Lim\, Ph.D.\nProfessor of Cellular and Molecular Pharma
 cology\nBiochemistry and Biophysics and Pharmaceutical Chemistry\nInvestig
 ator\, Howard Hughes Medical Institute\nByers Distinguished Professorship\
 nUniversity of California San Francisco\n\nAbstract\nThe eras of molecular
  biology and genomics have given us an unprecedented picture of the molecu
 lar components underlying living systems. Nonetheless\, our understanding 
 of how these components are assembled to generate precision physiological 
 systems remains far less developed. To approach this problem\, we and othe
 rs have been using synthetic biology methods to empirically explore how mo
 lecular components can be used to construct novel cellular functions. Usin
 g these approaches\, we have shown that we can reprogram living cellular m
 achines that carryout new novel precision functions\, including therapeuti
 c immune cells that precisely recognize and eliminate cancer cells\, or ce
 lls that self-organize into tissues. By merging our understanding of cellu
 lar machines with our knowledge of our bodies and its diseases\, we envisi
 on the development of a mature field of cell engineering with a toolbox of
  optimized molecular parts and circuit architectures\, as well as disease 
 and "GPS" sensors that allow the cell to target specific sites in the body
  or brain. Such a platform will allow us to rapidly and flexibly prototype
  and design cells that can identify sites of disease or degeneration and e
 xecute precisely targeted and controlled therapeutic actions.\n\nBiography
 \nWendell Lim is the Byers Distinguished Professor and Chair of the Depart
 ment of Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology at the University of Californi
 a San Francisco\, and an Investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institu
 te. He received his A.B. in Chemistry\, summa cum laude\, from Harvard Col
 lege\, his Ph.D. in Biochemistry and Biophysics at the Massachusetts Insti
 tute of Technology and completed his postdoctoral training at Yale Univers
 ity. His research focuses on the design principles of molecular circuits t
 hat govern cell decision-making and responses. His lab has made contributi
 ons in understanding the molecular machinery of cell signaling and how mol
 ecular modules have been used in evolution to build novel new behaviors. M
 ost recently he has been a pioneer in the emerging field of synthetic biol
 ogy\, exploring how these design principles can be harnessed to engineer c
 ells with customized therapeutic response programs. He is an author of the
  textbook\, Cell Signaling (Garland Science 2014) and was the founder of t
 he cell therapy biotech startup\, Cell Design Labs\, which was acquired by
  Gilead Biosciences in 2017.\n\nA community lunch will be served immediate
 ly following the presentation.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  https://www.bme.gatech.edu/

DESCRIPTION:Extras: Free Food\nStatus: approved\n\nCome one\, come all GT 
 Freshmen to this timeless event!\n\nThe Tradition\n\nIn 1911\, the first C
 ake Race was held as an open cross-country run at Georgia Tech. Two years 
 later\, some of the faculty members started baking cakes for the winners\,
  thus the name Cake Race. In 1935\, the Cake Race became a part of Homecom
 ing events in which freshman were required to run. After the Cake Race\, t
 he freshman male winner won his cake along with a kiss from the homecoming
  queen.\n\nToday\, the course has been shortened to half a mile and freshm
 an are no longer required\, but strongly encouraged to take part in the ra
 ce. The finish line is located on top of Freshman Hill near Bobby Dodd Sta
 dium where all freshmen receive cupcakes at the finish and the winners rec
 eive their cakes.\n\nThe Details:\n\nRace Day: Nov. 2 - 6:30 AM\n\nStart A

DESCRIPTION:Extras: Free Food\nStatus: approved\n\nTaste of Africa is a ga
 la inundated with treasures of African cultures. Treasures in the form of 
 art\, food\, comedy\, dance and a host of other entertainments are concent
 rated to enable our audience to interact fully with our vast multitude of 
 African cultures. Taste of Africa this year attempts to bridge the divide 
 that exists between Africans on the continent and Africans who have emigra
 ted from their respective countries to continue their lives outside the co
 ntinent. This year's theme\, Africans Crossing the Generations\, attempts 
 to explore this generational divide and seeks to foster discussion on the 
 cultural\, social\, economic\, and political differences that contribute t
 o this divide. The layout will include a dinner and art galleries in the r
 eception area\, a series of skits and dances throughout Taste of Africa in
  the theatre\, and an African inspired fashion show to highight the event.
