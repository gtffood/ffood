 \nDr. David Bruce Burckel: Sandia National Laboratories\nAbstract: Bulk op
 tical materials like glasses and semiconductors (for infrared appli-cation
 s) have continuous translational symmetry on the scale of the design wavel
 ength\, and hence support a continuum of allowed modes with frequency depe
 ndent optical constants dictated by the material dispersion relationship. 
 Much of the recent progress in optical materials has been driven by period
 ic structuring of materials on finer and finer scales relative to the desi
 gn wave-length. Recently metasurface optics employing planar plasmonic str
 uctures ar-rayed in a two-dimensional (2D) array to affect beam steering a
 nd lensing were reported. Subsequent analysis of the physical mechanisms a
 t play revealed that such a planar system has a maximum theoretical effici
 ency of 25%. The analysis further showed that by enabling current flow in 
 the third dimension\, the direction of travel through the lens\, this rest
 riction could be lifted.\n\nIn this seminar\, I will discuss our recent wo
 rk on fabrication and characterization of 3D meta-films\, suspended struct
 ures with sub-wavelength structuring along all three dimensions and a tota
 l thickness of < 4-μm. The struc-tures are fabricated on ~ 1-μm thick si
 licon nitride membranes using a new CMOS compatible membrane pro-jection l
 ithography (MPL) approach. Elimination of the bulk substrate allows us to 
 collect almost all the transmit-ted and reflected light from the sample an
 d simplifies modeling and design. The response of these 3D meta-films poss
 esses features characteristic of the metallic meta-atoms as well as slab p
 hotonic crystal resonances resulting from the periodic unit cell array\, t
 he nitride walls and support membrane. I will outline the fabrication sequ
 ence and present measured infrared transmission characterization of 3D uni
 t cells with vertically oriented elliptical plasmonic inclusions in the un
 it cell. Furthermore\, we demonstrate control over the coupling between th
 e plasmonic modes of the metallic inclusion and photonic crystal slab mode
 s of the support matrix by adjusting the dimensions of the inclusions. The
  ability to control the coupling between the unit cell decoration and the 
 unit cell matrix while also allowing for current flow in all three dimensi
 ons offers a powerful new design element for next generation optical eleme
 nts.\n\nBio: Bruce Burckel received his BS in Electrical Engineering from 
 the University of New Mexico in 1993\, at which point he was evenly split 
 between attending graduate school\, medical school or law school. Graduate
  school won out\, probably costing him millions of dollars in lifetime ear
 nings\, but he is only mildly bitter about this. He received his MS (1995 
 – optical non-contact temperature measurement) and PhD (2004 – general
 ized transverse Bragg waveguiding) also from the University of New Mexico\
 , separated by a stint contemplating a software start-up\, studying contro
 l system theory\, designing space-based relay mirror telescopes and studyi
 ng atmospheric propagation for high power laser applications. Although his
  PhD was centered on photonic applications of interferometric lithography 
 at the micro and nano-scale\, he secured a Post-Doctoral position in an in
 organic chemistry lab studying self-assembled nanocomposite coatings. He i
 s currently a Principal Member of the Technical Staff at Sandia National L
 aboratories\, where he leads several efforts in micron-scale 3D fabricatio
 n and structured electromagnetics. He is frequently found counseling stude
 nts on the importance of career planning\, as well as studying for the LCA
 T in local coffee shops.\n\nIf you wish to meet with the speaker\, please

 , Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\nStatus: published\n\nAbstract
 :\n\nMy research combines techniques in natural language processing\, mach
 ine learning and theories in social science to better understand human lan
 guage and build intelligent systems to support human-human and human-compu
 ter communication. In this talk\, I will explain my research from two spec
 ific studies. The first part studies what makes language persuasive by int
 roducing a semi-supervised neural network to recognize persuasion strategi
 es in loan requests on crowdfunding platforms\, and further designed neura
 l encoder-decoder systems to automatically transforming inappropriately su
 bjective framing into a neutral point of view. The second focuses on model
 ing how people seek and offer support via language in online cancer suppor
 t communities and building interventions to support patient communication.
  Through these examples\, I show how we can accurately and efficiently bui
 ld better language technologies for social good.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\nDiyi Y
 ang is an assistant professor in the School of Interactive Computing at Ge
 orgia Tech. She is interested in natural language processing (such as lang
 uage generation\, semantics\, discourse)\, and social computing. Diyi rece
 ived her PhD from the Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon U
 niversity\, and her bachelor's degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University\,
  China. She has published more than 40 papers at leading NLP/HCI conferenc
 es\, and received several best paper award nominations from EMNLP 2015\, I
 CWSM 2016\, and SIGCHI 2019. She has served as an area chair for ACL\, NAA
 CL and CSCW conferences.\n\nSchedule of Brown Bag Speakers Fall 2019 [1]\n

  (UAM) with electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft is emer
 ging as a promising aviation market for both cargo delivery and passenger 
 travel. The rise of UAM is being driven by the convergence of two technolo
 gies: autonomy and electric aircraft propulsion. Although promising\, thes
 e technologies place limits on the discovery of viable markets\, the timel
 ine of introduction\, and the design of operational paradigms. In particul
 ar\, electric propulsion—when achieved with battery energy storage—is 
 highly constraining in terms of aircraft payload\, range\, and speed perfo
 rmance and in terms of operational tempo and ground infrastructure. This t
 alk will discuss recent work in modeling aircraft performance and operatio
 ns for UAM and will highlight the challenges and opportunities in particul
 ar urban markets.\n\nSESSION SPEAKER\n\nBrian German [1]\, Daniel Guggenhe

 \nGames are an important form of play. While games are played by all age g
 roups\, for children\, play and games are fundamental to learning and\, fo
 r them\, all play is serious. Serious games\, which have become a prevalen
 t game genre for adults\, need not be confined to adult or adolescent audi
 ences. Both from the perspective of serious topics and serious gameplay\, 
 older children as they head towards adolescence\, and younger children as 
 they negotiate their way through their first years of school\, warrant the
  consideration of games developed to tackle topics that are becoming incre
 asingly important to their health and well-being. In games\, social value 
 can only be created through a narrative a child can relate to. Whether we 
 turn to David Winnicott on child development\, Jerome Bruner on acts of me
 aning\, or Kieran Egan on languaged learning\, story dominates as the most
  valuable experience in the construction of a child's world and how they a
 ct within it. The added context of a personal approach\, one that is cultu
 rally relevant\, can create an influential avenue through which children c
 an be provided with opportunities for gaining knowledge about problems tha
 t\, while they may be national or global\, are local to them – knowledge
  that could be critical to their well-being and survival in an increasingl
 y hostile world. Games offer children a space that supports learning on th
 eir own. Moving from the typical to the atypical game\, from simple proble
 m solving that increases cognitive skills\, to social problem solving that
  teaches empathy\, is a shift that can happen through participation in nar
 rative dialogue. Social value in a game can exist when the cognitive load 
 is not in computing numbers but in the challenge of uncovering the more in
 triguing stories beyond the surface of coded messages. In this talk I pres
 ent a case study that describes the design thinking process of a group of 
 EU Erasmus students\, each of whom brings their own cultural perspective a
 nd personal story to addressing how they would introduce children to conte
 mporary issues\, which either affect them currently\, or will affect them 
 as they grow up\, through narrative in physically engaging games. A number
  of their final game designs are provided in outline.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\nD
 r. Krystina Madej is Professor of the Practice at Georgia Tech\, Atlanta. 
 At Tech since 2011\, she teaches about and researches how humans have adap
 ted their narratives to changing media throughout the centuries\, physical
  play and children's interaction with digital games that are based in narr
 ative\, and in Disney's approach to stories across media since the 1920s. 
 Adjunct Professor with the School for Interactive Art and Technology (SIAT
 ) at Simon Fraser University\, Vancouver\, for ten years\, she taught as V
 isiting Professor for the Center for Digital Media's Master’s degree pro
 gram. She is research faculty at University of Lower Silesia\, Wroclaw\, P
 oland where as Visiting Professor she teaches Disney History and Children
 ’s Game Design for the Erasmus Program and Design Thinking and History o
 f Social Media for the Big Data\, Digital Media\, and Trendwatching Master
 ’s Program. Prior to returning to academia in 1999\, she was principal o
 f a communications and design firm for 15 years\, where\, as design strate
 gist\, she planned and created successful branding programs and exhibits f
 or government\, business\, industry\, and museums.\n\nSchedule of Brown Ba

 n\nMatthew Hong: Personalizing Health Management Through Human-Centered Da
 ta Augmentation\n\nDuring complex chronic treatment\, adolescent patients 
 (ages 10-19) must communicate all illness needs to the care team so they c
 an access relevant health resources when most needed. This communication i
 s challenging because patients\, family caregivers and clinicians have unm
 atched experiences\, conceptions and linguistic representations of indicat
 ors of health. Most importantly\, patients lack the means to capture and r
 epresent their felt illness experience. My colleagues and I addressed thes
 e challenges by advancing personalized computing technology and human-cent
 ric methods that inform collaborative approaches for managing personal hea
 lth data. In this talk\, I will describe how technology can be designed to
  effectively scaffold patients’ gradual participation in managing their 
 illness. I draw from Health Informatics\, Participatory Design\, and Human
 -Computer Interaction to show how we can augment clinically-generated\, an
 d patient-generated data in ways that cater to personal health needs. I wi
 ll discuss how human-centered data-augmentation can help designers create 
 intelligent systems to improve chronic care for pediatric patients.\n\nLar
 a Martin: Understanding the Technological and Experiential Requirements of
  Improvisational Storytelling Agents\n\nAlthough we are currently riding a
  technological wave of personal assistants\, many of these agents still st
 ruggle to communicate appropriately. Humans are natural storytellers\, so 
 it would be fitting if artificial intelligence could tell stories as well.
  Automated story generation is an area of AI research that aims to create 
 agents that tell “good” stories. Previous story generation systems use
  planning to create new stories\, but these systems require a vast amount 
 of knowledge engineering. The stories created by these systems are coheren
 t\, but only a finite set of stories can be generated. In contrast\, very 
 large language models have recently made the headlines in the natural lang
 uage processing community. Though impressive on the surface\, these models
  begin to lose coherence over time. My research looks at various technique
 s of automated story generation\, focusing on the perceived creativity of 
 the generated stories. Here\, I define a creative product as one that is b
 oth novel and useful. In my dissertation\, I theorize that a jointly proba
 bilistic and causal model will provide more creative stories for readers o
 f stories generated from an improvisational storytelling system than solel
 y probabilistic or causal models.\n\nEmily Wall: Mitigating Implicit Human
  Bias in Visual Analytics\n\nImplicit bias is a term used to describe the 
 way that our culture\, experiences\, and stereotypes can unconsciously imp
 act our attitudes and decision making. Such biases\, like racial or gender
  bias\, can impact decision making in critical ways\, propagating long-sta
 nding institutional and systemic biases. However\, as decision making is i
 ncreasingly taking place with the aid of data-driven visual representation
 s (including interactive visualization tools like Tableau\, among others)\
 , we are afforded a new opportunity with respect to the detection and miti
 gation of implicit biases. In this talk\, I describe (1) how user interact
 ions with data can be used to approximate implicit biases and (2) how visu
 alization systems can be designed to make implicit biases more explicit by
  increasing awareness. By creating systems that promote real-time awarenes
 s of bias\, people can reflect on their behavior and decision making and u
 ltimately engage in a less-biased decision making process.\n\nSpeaker Bios

 deployment of human-centered health technologies. He has published in lead

 CTS\n\nMichaelanne Dye\, Towards Access and Beyond: Human Infrastructures 
 in Constrained Contexts\n\nMore than four billion people across the world 
 have yet to access the internet. Despite increasing initiatives by compani
 es and governments to bring more people online\, social\, economic\, and p
 olitical barriers continue to limit internet engagements among underrepres
 ented groups. As a result\, people collaborate to overcome barriers to par
 ticipation\, particularly in politically and economically constrained cont
 exts. I address these concerns by focusing on the case of Cuba\, where up 
 until recently internet access was limited to just five percent of the pop
 ulation. Presenting results from qualitative inquiry in Havana from 2014 t
 o 2017\, I describe how participants are receiving and engaging with the i
 ncremental introduction of access to the world wide web. I also present in
 sights into how people have created their own versions of the internet in 
 response to barriers. I draw on the framework of human infrastructure to r
 eveal how people are sustaining multiple\, disconnected information networ
 ks\, and the tensions and opportunities that arise from these efforts. I w
 ill discuss how this work contributes to our understanding of the social e
 lements embedded in internet adoption and participation\, and how this cri
 tical understanding has implications for the design of social media system
 s in order to better support collaborative efforts of historically underre
 presented groups.\n\nCaitlyn Seim\, Wearable Tactile Stimulation for Strok
 e Rehabilitation\n\nStroke is one of the leading causes of disability in t
 he United States and globally. Many stroke survivors lose function in thei
 r upper extremities\, which can make it difficult to do everyday tasks lik
 e dressing or eating. In addition to weakness and loss of sensation\, spas
 ticity and tone can cause hands to be involuntarily clenched in a rigid po
 sition — a problem for which there are few effective treatments. Getting
  rehabilitation therapy can be a challenge and up to 50% of stroke survivo
 rs do not qualify for traditional exercise-based therapies. This talk intr
 oduces a novel stimulation method and mobile\, wearable devices to provide
  therapy on-the-go and to those with very limited movement. Preliminary re
 sults and next steps are presented. Our stimulation method may provide a p
 owerful tool to reduce disability after a stroke\, and the wearable form f
 actor allows users to receive intensive therapy during their normal daily 
 routine.\n\nStevie Chancellor\, Human-Centered Algorithms for Deviant Ment
 al Health Behaviors Online\n\nSocial media can provide a rich platform for
  those seeking better health and support through difficult experiences. Ye
 t\, it can also provide space for deviant mental health behaviors\, very d
 angerous and stigmatized behaviors related to mental health. These behavio
 rs are dangerous to participants as well as to platform health. However\, 
 the deep complexities of mental health and these clandestine behaviors res
 ist straightforward\, data-driven approaches to detection and intervention
 . In this talk\, I will describe how human-centered algorithms can identif
 y and assess deviant mental health behaviors in pro-eating disorder commun
 ities\, bringing insights from Human Computer Interaction\, applied data s
 cience\, and social computing. In addition\, I will show how these approac
 hes can inform platform strategies for engaging with these communities. Fi
 nally\, I will briefly discuss how human-centered insights can be brought 
 to computational methods to answer our toughest questions about deviant be
 havior online.\n\nSPEAKER BIOS\n\nMichaelanne Dye is a Ph.D. candidate in 
 Human-Centered Computing in the School of Interactive Computing at the Geo
 rgia Institute of Technology. Blending the fields of Social Computing and 
 ICTD (Information and Communication Technologies and Development)\, her wo
 rk uses qualitative methods to study how people access and participate wit
 h internet technologies in resource-constrained contexts with the goal of 
 informing the design of more equitable and inclusive technology. She recei
 ved her Master’s in Sociocultural Anthropology from Georgia State Univer
 sity\, and draws heavily on this background to engage in technology resear
 ch. Michaelanne is a Microsoft Research Ph.D. Fellow\, a three-time recipi
 ent of the Herz Global Impact Award\, and an American Rewards for College 
 Scientists (ARCS) Fellow. Her work has received Best Paper Honorable Menti
 on awards at the ACM CHI and CSCW conferences.\n\nCaitlyn Seim is a PhD ca
 ndidate in the School of Interactive Computing at the Georgia Institute of
  Technology. Her concentration is Human-Centered Computing with focuses on
  Artificial Intelligence and Neuroscience. She is an NSF Graduate Research
  Fellow and Microsoft Research PhD Fellow. Her research interests include 
 wearable computing\, haptics\, HCI\, rehabilitation\, and accessibility. M
 ore specifically\, her work examines human cognition and learning from hap
 tic interaction\, and creating new lightweight\, mobile devices for rehabi
 litation.\n\nStevie Chancellor is a PhD candidate in Human Centered Comput
 ing in Interactive Computing. Her research interest lies in Social Computi
 ng\, Data Science\, and HCI to understand online communities and mental he
 alth. Stevie’s work has won multiple Best Paper Honorable Mention awards
  at CHI and CSCW\, premier venues in human computer interaction. Her work 
 has been supported by a Snap Inc. Research Fellowship and has appeared in 
 national publications such as Wired and Gizmodo.\n\nHow to watch: If you c

 ics and Photonics for Biomedical Applications"\n\nNanostructuring of atomi
 cally-thin two-dimensional (2D) materials (e.g. graphene and MoS2) has sho
 wed promise to create new functionalities for various biomedical applicati
 ons\, especially flexible and wearable electronics. In this talk\, I will 
 discuss how nanostructuring of atomically-thin materials could create new 
 functionalities based on the fundamental studies of mechanics and photonic
 s at nanoscale. I will first discuss how nanostructuring of atomically-thi
 n 2D materials allows for the enhancement of their exceptional material pr
 operties and creating new functionalities in mechanical\, optical\, plasmo
 nic properties. I will also introduce a shrink nanomanufacturing method de
 veloped based on nanoscale mechanics of atomically-thin materials\, includ
 ing graphene and MoS2 atomic layers. Shrink nanomanufacturing allows large
 -scale\, uniform crumpling of graphene\, a two-dimensional (2D) material\,
  enabling mechanical stretchability and strain tunability of a flexible op
 toelectronic device. I will highlight a high-performance flexible photodet
 ector developed based on the shrink nanomanufacturing approach as well as 
 its potential in flexible/wearable optical sensing technology for biomedic
 al applications.\n\nLunch will be served at the beginning of the seminar.\

 a professional football player\, as well as:\n\n- Emerging technology that
  impacts the game\n- What it takes to become a successful entrepreneur\n- 
 Opportunities for innovation in athletics\n\nAbout the speaker: Instilled 
 with hard work at a young age by his mom\, Derrick Morgan began working as
  soon he was old enough to acclimate himself to the real world. After rece
 iving more recognition on the football field during his junior year of hig
 h school\, Derrick set his mind to college football and arrived on the cam
 pus of Georgia Tech. In 2010\, his next goal was accomplished as well with
  the Tennessee Titans drafted him. While his goal was soon realized\, a to
 rn ACL injury turned Derrick’s world upside down\, forcing him to evalua
 te his value outside the football field.\n\nAbout Deep Startups: Deep Star
 tups is an events series that features knowledgeable entrepreneurs who dis
 cuss their experiences forming companies that solve big-picture current pr
 oblems. These individuals speak to the concept of ‘deep startups’ and 
 how to create companies that make a difference in specific industries. Eac
 h Deep Startups event focuses on a different broad topic in engineering/te
 chnology\, and allows for student Q&A at the end of the event.\n\nLinks:\n

 \, Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\nStatus: published\n\nScience
  has made significant gains in the fight against infectious diseases in th
 e past several decades\, perhaps the most notable of which is declining mo
 rtality rates from HIV and hepatitis C. Nevertheless\, overall mortality r
 ates from all infectious diseases has remained relatively stable.\n\nThere
  are very real concerns about new drug development’s ability to keep up 
 with development of drug resistance and the speed at which infectious dise
 ases can cross the globe.\n\nIn early 2019\, Lien Van Hoecke and Kenny Roo
 se wrote in the Journal of Translational Medicine\, “Wider accessibility
  and implementation of antibody-based therapeutics is however hindered by 
 manufacturing challenges and high development costs inherent to protein-ba
 sed drugs. For these reasons\, alternative ways are being pursued to produ
 ce and deliver antibodies more cost-effectively without hampering safety. 
 Over the past decade\, messenger RNA (mRNA) based drugs have emerged as a 
 highly appealing new class of biologics that can be used to encode any pro
 tein of interest directly in vivo.”\n\nDr. Philip J. Santangelo is a Pro
 fessor in the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering. In 
 1998\, he obtained his Ph.D. in Engineering from the University of Califor
 nia at Davis\, and then was a postdoctoral fellowship at Sandia National L
 aboratories in Livermore\, California. He also spent time as a research fa
 culty member at Georgia Tech until becoming an Assistant Professor in 2007
 . Dr. Santangelo’s research focuses on the development of imaging tools 
 for the study of viral pathogenesis and immune responses\, and the develop
 ment of mRNA-based therapies and vaccines.\n\nOn Wednesday January 29th\, 
 2020\, Dr. Santangelo will discuss his research into mRNA-based therapeuti
 cs\, what they are and how we are using them for prevention and treatment.
 \n\nIf you are interested in new approaches to preventing and treating vir
 al infection\, including synthetic mRNA and gene modulation technology wil
 l find Dr. Santangelo’s Pediatric Tech Talk of high value.\n\nLunch will

 nScience journalist Eva Wolfangel has specialized in investigating the eff
 ects of future technologies on society - by accompanying people who alread
 y make intensive use of these technologies today. She spent weeks under a 
 VR headset researching social virtual reality\, and she finally visited he
 r new "virtual" friends in their real lives in Kuwait\, Israel and various
  US states. These people already spend a large part of their lives in virt
 ual reality - and that is no reason for cultural pessimism. In Japan\, Wol
 fangel has accompanied researchers working on human augmentation\, and she
  has tried out many of these technologies\, met people here who are alread
 y using them and talked to many about their dream of an augmented future. 
 In this talk\, Eva Wolfangel discusses her research and how future technol
 ogies are already changing society today.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\nEva Wolfangel

 \, Undergraduate students\nStatus: published\n\nGA Tech Ocean Science and 
 Engineering Presents Dr. Donald R. Webster\, GA Tech School Civil and Envi
 ronmental Engineering\nUnderwater Flight of the Pteropod\n\nThe swimming c
 haracteristics achieved by flapping wings\, translating motion\, and shell
  pitching are studied from observations of shelled Antarctic pteropods (aq
 uatic snails nicknamed `sea butterfies'). A portable tomographic particle 
 image velocimetry (tomo-PIV) system was used to study these pteropods (Lim
 acina helicina antarctica) swim with a pair of parapodia (or “wings”) 
 via a unique flapping propulsion mechanism that incorporates similar techn
 iques as observed in small flying insects.\n\nThe swimming velocity is typ
 ically 14 – 30 mm/s for pteropod size ranging 1.5 – 5 mm\, and the pte
 ropod shell pitches forward-and-backward at 1.9 – 3 Hz. The pitching mot
 ion of the shell effectively positions the parapodia such that they flap d
 ownwards during both power and recovery strokes. The tomo-PIV measurements
  reveal the influence of the vortex structure created and shed from the pa
 rapodia on the generated lift forces.\n\nThe non-dimensional variables cha
 racterizing the motion of swimming pteropods are flapping\, translating\, 
 and pitching Reynolds numbers (i.e. Ref\, ReU\, and ReΩ). The observed sp
 ecimens swim within the same optimal Strouhal number range as observed for
  a broad range of species in air and water. The complex combination of bod
 y kinematics\, flow structures\, and resulting force balance may be signif
 icantly altered by thinning of the pteropod shell\, thus making pteropods 
 an indicator of the detrimental effects of ocean acidification.\n\nWebinar

 ulty who serve on reappointment\, promotion\, and/or tenure committees and
  faculty search committees are required to participate in an Implicit Bias
  Workshop pursuant to Provost Bras’ memo in October 2016 to academic lea
 ders. However\, all instructional and research faculty are welcomed to att
 end as space permits.\n\nThe goals of these workshops are to increase awar
 eness of the impact of implicit bias and facilitate equitable decision-mak
 ing across myriad processes related to faculty evaluations. As a participa
 nt in the workshop\, you will learn the following:\n\n• An introduction 
 to the concept of implicit bias and how these unconscious\, automatic ment
 al processes may impact behaviors such as evaluating candidates during fac
 ulty search and/or RPT processes.\n\n• Empirical research on vitaes\, le
 tters of recommendations\, and teaching evaluations to illustrate the impa
 ct of implicit bias on decisions.\n\n• Effective practices and strategie
 s for faculty search and RPT committees.\n\nThese workshops will be facili
 tated by Paul Benkeser\, senior associate chair and professor\, Wallace H.
  Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering\; Harris Dimitropoulos\, ass
 ociate professor\, School of Architecture\; Robert Kirkman\, associate pro

 ed her new "virtual" friends in their real lives in Kuwait\, Israel and va
 rious US states. These people already spend a large part of their lives in
  virtual reality - and that is no reason for cultural pessimism. In Japan\
 , Wolfangel has accompanied researchers working on human augmentation\, an
 d she has tried out many of these technologies\, met people here who are a
 lready using them and talked to many about their dream of an augmented fut
 ure. In this talk\, Eva Wolfangel discusses her research and how future te
 chnologies are already changing society today.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\nEva Wolf

 . Lakshmi N. Sankar)\n\nwill propose a doctoral thesis entitled\,\n\nAppli
 cation of an Extended Messinger Model to Ice Accretion on Complex Geometri
 es\n\nOn\n\nFriday\, February 7 at 10:00 a.m.\nMontgomery Knight Building 
 317\n\nAbstract\nIce accretion can significantly degrade the performance a
 nd the stability of an airborne vehicle. Therefore\, it is important to mo
 del this phenomenon accurately. While researchers have conducted extensive
  ice accretion studies in the past on airplane wings and helicopter blades
 \, very few of these studies are for more complex geometries such as fusel
 ages. This work proposes a methodology that extends an existing in-house E
 xtended Messinger ice accretion solver to complex geometries on unstructur
 ed grids\, with a marching process along surface streamlines to handle thr
 ee-dimensional flow effects.\n\nThe work completed to date includes sensit
 ivity studies for ice accretion and shedding on shortened Schweizer 269 ma
 in rotor blades and two-dimensional steady and oscillating airfoil ice acc
 retion cases\, on structured grids. Towards the goal of developing unstruc
 tured grid based methodologies\, several different cases with varying leve
 ls of complexity have been completed. These include a commercial transport
  airfoil\, a three-dimensional MS(1)-317 swept wing at different angles of
  attack\, and the Robin fuselage.\n\nUnstructured grid based analyses usin
 g commercial solvers such as STAR-CCM+ and ANSYS Fluent have been used to 
 date for the flow field and water droplet dispersed phase computations. Th
 e ice accretion is carried out using an in-house analysis called GT-ICE. T
 he predictions by GT-ICE have compared to available experimental data\, an
 d to predictions by LEWICE\, an industry standard solver developed at the 
 NASA Glenn Research Center.\n\nThe proposed work includes the development 
 of an unstructured grid based Eulerian droplet trajectory and collection e
 fficiency methodology using public domain modules within OpenFOAM\, couple
 d to a surface streamline visualization and data extraction process using 
 the public domain solver ParaView. GT-ICE will be employed for ice accreti
 on computations. The new methodology is capable of handling 2D and 3D\, st
 ructured and unstructured\, steady and unsteady flow analyses.\n\nCommitte

 uman brain is the most complex system on earth. However\, there are no wel
 l-developed human brain models to study the brain activities in either lab

  environments that reconstruct a 3D human brain in Alzheimer’s disease (
 AD) by recapitulating AD signature of elevated levels of amyloid-beta (A-b
 eta)\, tau proteins\, activation of microglia\, immune cells resident in a
  central nervous system (CNS)\, and consequent neuronal damage. In particu
 lar\, the model mirrored microglial neurotoxic activities such as axonal c
 leavage and neurotoxic release.\n\nLunch will be provided at the beginning

 \nDirect Write Processing of 3D Composite Nanostructures and 2D Electronic
  Materials using Focused Beams of Molecules and Electrons\nProf. Andrei Fe
 dorov - School of Mechanical Engineering\, Georgia Tech\nAbstract: Focused
  Electron Beam Induced Processing (FEBIP) is a powerful method for atom-by
 -atom fabrication of topologically complex nanostructures from a variety o
 f materials. It has potential to provide a comprehensive processing enviro
 nment for emerging electronic and quantum devices based on 2D materials. W
 e are developing a family of multi-mode energized micro/nano-jet technique
 s for local precursor delivery to resolve the FEBID challenges and to expa
 nd the range of useful precursors from gas to liquid phase for broader FEB
 IP applications. Energized micro/nano-jets of thermally or electro-kinetic
 ally energized precursors in both gas and liquid phase provide unique capa
 bilities for localized delivery of precursor molecules to the substrate\, 
 thus establishing locally controlled deposition/etching site for FEBIP. Un
 derstanding of fascinating and interacting chemistry and physics on the mo
 st fundamental level will be discussed as a route to develop new FEBIP mod
 es and applications to emerging electronic and quantum devices based on 2D
  materials.\n\nBio: Andrei G. Fedorov is Rae S. and Frank H. Chaired Profe
 ssor in the School of Mechanical Engineering and the Petit Institute for B
 ioengineering and Biosciences at Georgia Tech. His current research focuse
 s on electron-beam-mediated nanomanufacturing\, MEMS-enabled bioanalytical
  instrumentation\, thermal management of high performance electronics\, an
 d power generation with synergetic CO2 capture. Fedorov has authored/co-au
 thored over 200 archival articles in premier technical journals. His resea
 rch has led to development of new technologies for various applications\, 
 resulting in over 40 issued US patents and pending patent applications. Fo
 r his inventions of biomedical devices\, the World Technology Network (WTN
 )\, in cooperation with AAAS Science Magazine\, CNN\, and leading technolo
 gy companies\, selected Fedorov as a WTN Associate and one of the twenty-f
 ive “most innovative people and organizations in the science and technol
 ogy world” nominated for the 2005 World Technology Award in Health and M
 edicine. He was recognized with the US National Aeronautics and Space Admi
 nistration (NASA) Invention & Contribution Board Award for development of 
 catalytic reactor technologies\, as well as multiple inventor recognition 
 awards from the Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC) and Microelectron
 ics Advanced Research Corporation (MARCO).\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatec

 , Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\nStatus: draft\n\nAbstract:\n\
 nGeorgia Tech has been at the forefront of sustainability since its incept
 ion in the 1880's. This is evidenced by the fact that the original brick b
 uildings on campus were made from indigenous Georgia red clay\, and Grant 
 Field was the home to football\, baseball and track. Fast forward to 2019 
 where we have just built the Kendeda Building for Innovative Sustainable D
 esign\, slated to be one of the most sustainable buildings in the southeas
 t\, on the path to meet the stringent requirements of the Living Building 
 Challenge. Come learn about the evolution of Georgia Tech's 400-acre ecosy
 stem and our commitment to sustainable campus development.\n\nSpeaker Bio:
 \n\nHoward Wertheimer is a Fellow in the American Institute of Architects 
 and a LEED Accredited Professional. From 2006-2019\, Howard served as the 
 AVP for Capital Planning & Space Management and Institute Architect at the
  Georgia Institute of Technology where he had strategic oversight of the C
 ampus Master Plan\, Landscape Master Plan\, Historic Preservation Plan\, c
 ampus-wide sustainability initiatives\, curation of public art\, and most 
 things visually exposed. He was responsible for the aesthetics and visual 
 vocabulary of the campus\, which currently includes over 16M square feet o
 f space in 200 buildings on 400 acres in Atlanta\, Georgia.\n\nWhile at Ge
 orgia Tech\, Howard lead the development of the Kendeda Building for Susta
 inable Design and has delivered numerous papers across the country on Geor
 gia Tech’s Living Building journey\, anticipated to be one the most envi
 ronmentally advanced education and research buildings on a university camp
 us in the Southeast.\n\nHoward is currently the Executive Vice President a
 nd Chief Operating Officer at the Piedmont Park Conservancy\, a non-profit
  overseeing the stewardship\, operations\, financial procedures\, programs
  and overall performance to cultivate substantial and sustainable growth o
 f Atlanta’s iconic Piedmont Park\, which is the heart and soul of the ci
 ty.\n\nSchedule of Brown Bag Speakers Spring 2020 [1]\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http

DESCRIPTION:Extras: Free Food\, Free Stuff\nStatus: approved\n\nBennett & 
 Pless is a highly regarded specialty structural engineering firm founded i
 n 1964 in Atlanta. Over the past 55 years\, the firm has developed a reput
 ation for being industry leaders in the niche markets in which it has chos
 en to practice\, rather than evolving into a traditional large generalist 
 structural engineering firm. As a result of this focus\, the firm has deve
 loped specialized skills and attracted highly experienced engineers. This 
 has resulted in being called upon to execute more complex structural engin
 eering projects.\n\nThe firm has offices in multiple states in the US\, bu
 t provides specialty services across the country and internationally. Benn
 ett & Pless’ sister company BPL Enclosure Engineering provides enclosure
  and ETFE engineering throughout the US and Western Europe.\n\nLinks:\n[0]

 ly\nGraduating global citizens is one of Georgia Tech’s strategic goals\
 , yet many students don’t have the opportunity to study abroad. What are
  we doing at home to help students engage in global challenges and develop
  intercultural communication skills? In this workshop\, we invite particip
 ants to consider how integrating the United Nations Sustainable Developmen
 t Goals (SDGs) into their courses will help foster global citizenship no m
 atter where students are learning. The UN SDGs [1] are a set of 17 broad a
 nd interconnected goals that address the global challenges we face. We arg
 ue that the SDGs can be incorporated into any course regardless of discipl
 ine. Faculty members from diverse programs at Georgia Tech will share exam
 ples of how they have incorporated the SDGs into their courses. Workshop p
 articipants will have the opportunity to articulate their vision for how t
 he SDGs may work in their own course and identify (and propose) resources 
 that can help support them in realizing it.\n\nWorkshop facilitators:\n\n-

 , Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\nStatus: review\n\nAbstract:\n
 \nImagine a 1D curve\, then use it to fill a 2D manifold that covers an ar
 bitrary 3D object – this computationally intensive materials challenge h
 as been realized in the ancient technology known as knitting. This process
  for making functional materials 2D materials from 1D portable cloth dates
  back to prehistory\, with the oldest known examples dating from the 11th 
 century BCE. Knitted textiles are ubiquitous as they are easy and cheap to
  create\, lightweight\, portable\, flexible and stretchy. As with many fun
 ctional materials\, the key to knitting’s extraordinary properties lies 
 in its microstructure.\n\nAt the 1D level\, knits are composed of an inter
 locking series of slip knots. At the most basic level there is only one ma
 nipulation that creates a knitted stitch – pulling a loop of yarn throug
 h another loop. However\, there exist hundreds of books with thousands of 
 patterns of stitches with seemingly unbounded complexity.\n\nThe topology 
 of knitted stitches has a profound impact on the geometry and elasticity o
 f the resulting fabric. This puts a new spin on additive manufacturing –
  not only can stitch pattern control the local and global geometry of a te
 xtile\, but the creation process encodes mechanical properties within the 
 material itself. Unlike standard additive manufacturing techniques\, the i
 nnate properties of the yarn and the stitch microstructure has a direct ef
 fect on the global geometric and mechanical outcome of knitted fabrics.\n\
 nSpeaker Bio:\n\nElisabetta Matsumoto is an assistant professor in the Sch
 ool of Physics at Georgia Institute of Technology. Her physics research ce
 nters around the relationship between geometry and material properties in 
 soft systems\, including liquid crystals\, 3D printing and textiles. She i
 s also interested in using sewing\, 3D printing and virtual reality in mat
 hematical art and education. She is the recipient of an NSF CAREER award. 
 She studied physics at the University of Pennsylvania\, earning her BA and
  MS in 2007 and her PhD in 2011. She has been knitting and crochet since s
 he was about 12 and has been sewing for longer than she can remember.\n\nS

 r engineer be a good policymaker?\n● What strategies and tactics can Tec
 h students and alumni use to have more impact?\n\nAfter graduating from Ge
 orgia Tech (Physics)\, Professor Barke earned a Ph.D. in Political Science
  from the University of Rochester. He has advised agencies in the U.S. and
  abroad\, the U.S. Congress\, and companies on how to incorporate expert s
 cientific advice into public policy. In this lecture\, he shares what he h
 as learned over the years about the effectiveness of scientists in politic
 al arenas. Examples include cases from FDA\, EPA\, FCC\, NASA\, and the U.
 S. Congress. Professor Barke’s research focuses on the roles of politics
  within science and of science within politics\, and the regulation of ris
 k (particularly the FDA). Dr. Barke has written about topics such as the p
 olitical behavior of scientific disciplines\, the politics of science budg
 eting in Congress\, and how scientists translate scientific findings into 
 policy recommendations. Recent works involve the decision making processes
  by which science and ethics are reconciled in the regulation of research\
 , particularly research involving human subjects and in nanotechnology. Cu
 rrently he is writing a book about political\, cognitive\, and economic ob
 stacles to long-term policy making.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.edu/n

 , Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\nStatus: draft\n\nAbstract:\n\
 nThere is increasing excitement about reinforcement learning--a subarea of
  machine learning for enabling an agent to learn to make good decisions. Y
 et numerous questions and challenges remain for reinforcement learning to 
 help support progress in applications that involve interacting with people
 \, like education\, consumer marketing and healthcare. I will discuss our 
 work on some of the technical challenges that arise in this pursuit\, incl
 uding sample efficiency\, counterfactual reasoning\, robustness\, and appl
 ications to health and education.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\nEmma Brunskill is an 
 assistant professor in the Computer Science Department at Stanford Univers
 ity where she leads the AI for Human Impact group. Her work focuses on rei
 nforcement learning in high stakes scenarios--how can an agent learn from 
 experience to make good decisions when experience is costly or risky\, suc
 h as in educational software\, healthcare decision making\, or people-faci
 ng applications. She was previously a professor at Carnegie Mellon Univers
 ity. She is the recipient of multiple early faculty career awards (Nationa
 l Science Foundation\, Office of Naval Research\, Microsoft Research) and 
 her group has received several best research paper nominations (CHI\, EDMx
 3) and awards (UAI\, RLDM).\n\nSchedule of Brown Bag Speakers Spring 2020

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Public\
 , Undergraduate students\nStatus: published\n\nmy PhD thesis titled "Impor
 tance of Manganese oxides in carbon remineralization in river-dominated co
 ntinental margins and the biogeochemical cycling of arsenic" on February 2
 7th at 1 pm in Ford EST L1114. My committee members include Dr. Martial Ta
 illefert (advisor\, GT EAS)\, Dr. Yuanzhi Tang (GT\, EAS) Dr. Thomas DiChr
 istina (GT\, BIO)\, Dr. Frank Stewart (Montana State University)\, Dr. Geo
 rge Luther (Univ. of Delaware)\, and Dr. Christophe Rabouille (Univ d'Sacl
 ay\, CEA\, LSCE\, France). My abstract is included below.\n\nBest regards\
 ,\n\nShannon Owings\n\nManganese oxides (MnO2) are ubiquitous in the envir
 onment and play an important role in the transformation and transport of c
 ontaminants in the environment in addition to play a major role in the bio
 geochemical cycling of carbon. This study investigated both aspects of the
 se roles using a combination of laboratory experiments and field work. Fir
 st\, the kinetics of oxidation of the more toxic arsenic form\, arsenite (
 As(III))\, to the less mobile form\, arsenate (As(V))\, by MnO2 was determ
 ined and compared to literature data to investigate the mechanism of the r
 eaction. Subsequently\, the effect of low As(V) concentrations on the anae
 robic microbial respiration of MnO2 and iron oxides\, Fe(OH)3\, were inves
 tigated to shed light into the mechanism of As(V) toxicity in aquatic envi
 ronments. At low As(V) concentrations\, microbial reduction rates were inc
 reased compared to arsenic-free treatments suggesting As(V) at low concent
 rations stimulates metal reduction (MnO2\, Fe(OH)3) in sediments as a resu
 lt of a catalytic cycle in which arsenic is constantly reduced via microbi
 al detoxification and re-oxidized by MnO2. The cumulative findings from th
 is study suggest that arsenic is not simply immobilized in sediments and t
 hat a suite of complex abiotic and microbial processes including adsorptio
 n\, intracellular transport\, and redox reactions may affect the transport
  of arsenic in the environment\, and ultimately the quality of drinking wa
 ter resources.\n\nIn parallel to laboratory experiments\, manganese cyclin
 g\, and the dominant redox pathways involved in carbon remineralization pr
 ocesses were characterized in marine sediments across the Louisiana shelf 
 and slope that are exposed to mineral and terrestrial organic inputs from 
 the Mississippi River. Although sulfate reduction dominates on the contine
 ntal shelf\, denitrification and microbial manganese reduction appear equa
 lly significant anaerobic respiration processes along the continental slop
 e the closest to the Mississippi River. This study emphasizes how the diff
 erential oxidation kinetics of Mn2+ (slow) and Fe2+ (fast) as well as sedi
 ment transport processes influence the main pathways of carbon degradation
  in these regions. Overall this thesis emphasizes the importance of charac
 terizing the fundamental molecular processes of complex systems to better 
 understand large scale global biogeochemical cycles.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http:

 ity\n\nAbstract:\n\n-----------\n\nHumans have an inherent understanding o
 f the shape of their environment and the objects contained in it. Given a 
 description of a room\, a person can understand a reasonable approximation
  of the space and the objects. However\, our current methods lack this typ
 e of contextual understanding (i.e. a chair is shaped a particular way and
  indicates you can sit on it). This work is motivated by the idea that the
 re is an inherent relationship between 3D information such as shape and sc
 ene understanding/object classification. Objects such as tables\, chairs\,
  and cups have a specific shape and our models should leverage and learn t
 hat information. Depth and surface normals have frequently been used as ad
 ditional signals in semantic labeling work\; however\, there is still limi
 ted understanding on using and learning shape and labels jointly. Our work
  examines using 3D cues for unsupervised and supervised approaches for seg
 mentation and semantic labeling. We show how to use 3D information for rob
 ust unsupervised segmentation\, supervised semantic labeling using segment
 ation\, and unsupervised object categorization. We explore this relationsh
 ip further by showing how shape helps deep neural networks semantically la
 bel indoor environments. We explore how joint estimation of shape and labe
 ls improves both results when learned together and how they can both be do
 ne with little added model capacity.\n\nThis defense aims to demonstrate h
 ow 3D cues may be used to improve semantic labeling and object classificat
 ion. Specifically\, we will consider depth\, surface normals\, object clas
 sification\, and pixel-wise semantic labeling in this work. The works outl
 ined aim to validate the following thesis statement: Shape is used as an a
 dditional context that improves segmentation\, unsupervised clustering\, o
 bject classification\, and semantic labeling with little computational ove
 rhead.\n\nThe presented work will show:\n\nCombining shape and object labe
 ls improves results (1) requires few extra parameters to do so\, (2) impro
 ves with surface normals more than with depth\, and (3) improves accuracy 
 for each task. We describe various methods to combine shape and object cla
 ssification and then discuss our extensions of the proposed work which foc
 us on surface normal prediction and semantic labeling specifically.\n\nLin

 \nOptimization over the Diffeomorphism Group Using Riemannian BFGS with Ap
 plication\nAbstract. The set of diffeomorphisms of the unit interval\, or 
 “warping functions\,” plays an important role in many in functional da
 ta analysis applications. Most prominently\, the problem of registering\, 
 or aligning\, pairs of functions depends on solving for an element of the 
 diffeomorphism group that\, when applied to one function\, optimally align
 s it to the other. The registration problem is posed as the unconstrained 
 minimization of a cost function over the infinite dimensional diffeomorphi
 sm function space. We make use of its well-known Riemannian geometry – t
 he positive orthant of the unit Hilbert sphere under the L2 metric – to 
 implement an efficient\, limited memory Riemannian BFGS optimization schem
 e. We compare performance and results to the benchmark algorithm\, Dynamic
  Programming\, on several functional datasets. Additionally\, we apply our
  methodology to the problem of non-parametric density estimation and compa
 re to the benchmark performance of MATLAB’s built-in kernel density esti
 mator ‘ksdensity’.\n\nBiography.\n\nDarshan Bryner received his B.S. d
 egree in Applied Mathematics in 2007 and his M.S. degree in Mathematics in
  2008\, both from Georgia Institute of Technology. In 2008\, he joined the
  Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) as a researc
 h scientist. While employed at NSWC PCD\, in 2010 he began work on his Ph.
 D. degree in Statistics at Florida State University and graduated in 2013.
  Under the co-advisement of Dr. Anuj Srivastava and Dr. Eric Klassen\, his
  thesis was on developing affine invariant\, elastic shape models to use a
 s prior distributions in a Bayesian active contour method for sonar image 
 segmentation. Dr. Bryner continues his research at NSWC PCD in a variety o
 f areas including Riemannian geometry and manifold optimization\, Bayesian
  inference in spatial statistics\, and bioinformatics. Since 2017\, Dr. Br
 yner has served as the head of the Advanced Signal Processing and Automati
 c Target Recognition Branch (Code X23) within the Science and Technology D
 epartment at NSWC PCD.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.edu/node/632525#0\

SUMMARY:Tools to Facilitate Multiple Means of Assessment

 n\nPlease register [1] to attend this upcoming teaching with technology wo
 rkshop!\n\nEvery semester we engage Georgia Tech students in a variety of 
 assessment experiences that are intended to determine what they have learn
 ed. For a number of these students\, however\, our assessments fall short 
 of their goal. Whether it’s due to language differences or to the fact t
 hat their brains are wired differently\, many students don’t get a chanc
 e to fully demonstrate what they know—and we don’t get a chance to fin
 d out the impact of our teaching.\n\nHow common is this experience? It may
  surprise you to learn that neurodivergent-related accommodations are now 
 the most frequent accommodation type at Georgia Tech. Regardless of whethe
 r you’re teaching to the highly diverse student population of an online 
 at-scale course or you’re teaching a small class of residential students
 \, you are likely to encounter students who require more diversity in asse
 ssment if you want to truly evaluate their learning experience.\n\nAlthoug
 h the thought of providing multiple types of assessments can be overwhelmi
 ng\, technology can be a great help. In this workshop\, we will explore a 
 variety of technologies such as Gradescope and Kaltura that will make it e
 asier for you to create\, collect\, and provide feedback on assessments th
 at allow for multiple means of action and expression. We will discuss how 
 the principles of Universal Design for Learning (UDL) can aid us in creati
 ng assessments that allow every student to demonstrate their learning. And
  we will hear from hear from Anne Jannarone\, Assistant Dean and Director 
 of the Office of Disability Services\, about neurodivergent students at Ge
 orgia Tech and what resources are available to you.\n\nJoin us and learn f
 irst-hand about multiple means of assessment and the technologies that mak
 e this process possible. Bring your laptop to explore examples during hand
 s-on activities\, or simply follow along with someone at your table. Wheth
 er you’re teaching large diverse populations in the online OMS program o
 r an array of students in a face-to-face course on campus\, there are ways
  that both you and your students can benefit from multiple means of assess
 ment. We look forward to seeing you at the workshop!\n\nLunch will be prov
 ided. Please register [1] [2] to join us!\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech

  Seminar\, Dr. Andrew Dickerson\, University of Central Florida\nNatural s
 ystems often inspire new methods by which to control fluids\, or conversel
 y use fluids to control systems. Three fluid mechanic systems that might c
 ome to mind include: the jetting of microdroplets when peeling an orange\,
  the droplet ejection off of a mosquito wing\, and the splash suppression 
 provided by floating toilet paper during defecation. These phenomena at th
 e interface of biology and fluid mechanics can provide engineers with usef
 ul\, inspired information for future designs. Here we study the explosive 
 dispersal of oil emitted from ‘cracked’ glands in the peels of citrus 
 fruit. The jetting oil undergoes an extreme acceleration to reach velociti
 es in excess of 10 m/s. On a slightly larger scale\, the method mosquitoes
  use to ‘buzz’ their wings free of deposited water drops prompts a loo
 k into how flexible surfaces may be vibrated to self-dry. We find drop eje
 ction is dependent on drop and wing properties\, and wing motion in this h
 ighly-coupled system. On yet a larger scale\, the dynamics of the entry of
  solids into liquid baths\, such as the ‘plop’ of restroom use\, is he
 avily influenced by free surface conditions\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gate

 ay\n\nRobotic systems have been very successful in performing tasks where 
 the inputs are well defined and known in advance. Automotive and electroni
 c manufacturing are the classic success stories where robotic systems have
  demonstrated incredible value for the industry. In unstructured manufactu
 ring\, the inputs of the system can vary significantly\, but the outputs o
 f the system are defined. Food and agriculture production are examples of 
 this type of unstructured manufacturing problem\, but traditional manufact
 uring is also moving in this direction as robotics move beyond welding and
  painting. This presentation will give examples of systems that integrate 
 advanced perception and control technologies into robotic systems to perfo
 rm complex tasks like cutting\, grasping\, and manipulation of objects in 
 an unstructured environment.\n\nRegister Online for upcoming SCL IRC semin

SUMMARY:GVU Center Brown Bag: David Reitter "Modeling Language in its Visu

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Public\
 , Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\nStatus: published\n\nAbstract
 :\n\nWords are always spoken and understood in context. Linguists\, psycho
 logists and computer scientists have recognized this when they defined wor
 d meaning using their aggregate linguistic contexts across large samples. 
 Early examples include Latent Semantic Indexing (Landauer & Dumais 1997)\,
  while recently\, some computational models have become vastly successful 
 in NLP\, such as Word2Vec (Mikolov et al\, 2013) or BERT (Devlin et al.\, 
 2018).\n\nHowever\, when young children learn to speak\, they refer to a m
 uch richer context than language alone. Their parents expose them to a ric
 h visual world\, and that is also a common context for adult language use.
  In this talk\, I argue that modern models for commonsense reasoning and n
 atural language processing should therefore learn from visual and linguist
 ic data.\n\nI will present two examples of multimodal neural models that c
 an bring together visual and linguistic context. One is a language model t
 hat predicts next words better when trained on image embeddings in additio
 n to their captions (Ororbia et al.\, ACL 2019). The other is a BERT-based
  model that set a new state-of-the-art in visual commonsense reasoning\, c
 hoosing answers to questions about movie stills and also giving a reason f
 or these answers (Alberti et al.\, EMNLP 2019). It is pre-trained on a WWW
  corpus of images and ALT tags (texts added for accessibility purposes) be
 fore learning to answer questions about the movie screenshots.\n\nSpeaker 
 Bio:\n\nDavid Reitter is a senior research scientist at Google Research\, 
 New York City\, where he works on modeling conversational and multimodal i
 nteraction using very large-scale data. Until recently\, he was an associa
 te professor of information sciences at Penn State. There\, his research g
 roup carried out NSF-funded research on computational models of human cogn
 ition. David did his postdoc in psychology at Carnegie Mellon University a
 nd holds a PhD in informatics from the University of Edinburgh (2008).\n\n

 te Diversity\, in collaboration with the Office of the Vice Provost for Gr
 aduate Education and Faculty Development and Georgia Tech’s ADVANCE Prog
 ram\, is offering Implicit Bias Workshops for faculty this spring. All fac
 ulty who serve on reappointment\, promotion\, and/or tenure committees and
  faculty search committees are required to participate in an Implicit Bias
  Workshop pursuant to Provost Bras’ memo in October 2016 to academic lea
 ders. However\, all instructional and research faculty are welcomed to att
 end as space permits.\n\nThe goals of these workshops are to increase awar
 eness of the impact of implicit bias and facilitate equitable decision-mak
 ing across myriad processes related to faculty evaluations. As a participa
 nt in the workshop\, you will learn the following:\n\n• An introduction 
 to the concept of implicit bias and how these unconscious\, automatic ment
 al processes may impact behaviors such as evaluating candidates during fac
 ulty search and/or RPT processes.\n\n• Empirical research on vitaes\, le
 tters of recommendations\, and teaching evaluations to illustrate the impa
 ct of implicit bias on decisions.\n\n• Effective practices and strategie
 s for faculty search and RPT committees.\n\nThese workshops will be facili
 tated by Paul Benkeser\, senior associate chair and professor\, Wallace H.
  Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering\; Harris Dimitropoulos\, ass
 ociate professor\, School of Architecture\; Robert Kirkman\, associate pro
 fessor\, School of Public Policy\; Mark Mitchell\, associate director\, Ge
 orgia Tech Research Institute\; and/or Michelle Rinehart\, associate dean 
 for academic affairs and outreach\, College of Design.\n\nTo register for 
 one of the workshops\, visit [1]. Lunch will be provided.\n\nGTRI research

 ill offer a short course on micro-fabrication from March 16th - 18th\, 202
 0. This in tensive 3 day short course combines classroom lectures and labo
 ratory based hands-on fabrication in the IEN cleanroom. The goal of the co
 urse is to impart a basic understanding of the science and technology of m
 icro-fabrication processes as used in academia and industry.\n\nThis short
  course will cover essential micro-fabrication techniques including\, phot
 olithography\, thin film deposition\, etching\, packaging\, and characteri
 zation. Attendees will gain valuable experience by fabricating simple devi
 ces in one of the most advanced uni versity cleanrooms in North America.\n
 \nAttendance is open to the general technical community and is not limited
  to current Georgia Tech students or IEN users. Anyone interested in clean
 room fabrication techniques is strongly encouraged to attend this course. 
 The course is suitable for both new and experienced researchers interested
  in micro-fabrication techniques and applications.\n\nA course emphasis wi
 ll be placed on IEN cleanroom resources\, however\, the concepts and techn
 iques discussed are applicable to a broad array of research in this field.
 \n\nRates: *Rates include lunches on all days*\n\n- Georgia Tech Rate: $20
 0\n- Academic and Government Rate: $400\n- Industry Rate: $800\n\nDue to t

 \, Public\, Undergraduate students\nStatus: published\n\nThis event is gen
 erously sponsored by the Georgia Tech College of Design and the Center for
  Computing and Societies.\n\nBackground\nUrban Analytics (UA) and Smart Ci
 ties (SC) research and degree programs are becoming more common in the U.S
 . and globally. UA and SC research has helped developed powerful technique
 s for spatial data creation\, capture and analysis and has drawn talented 
 individuals to this research.\n\nYet\, these programs and research agendas
  often operate without an explicit ‘plan’ for how technology and data 
 analysis will tackle real world issues. Because these fields are founded w
 ith technocratic and engineering problem-solving ideals (values inherent t
 o analytics and ‘smart’ endeavors)\, research questions and execution 
 in this field may be need re-definition and intervention if they are to he
 lp cities reach the most vulnerable citizens and improve daily life. Resea
 rch and thought leadership in UA and SC should include the voices and inpu
 t of the typical urbanite and those most in need. This field also should d
 eeply consider how different perspectives on race\, ethnicity\, gender\, s
 exual-orientation\, disability and poverty status (and more) may add cruci
 al variables to the study of urban analytics.\n\nResearch Contribution\nWe
  will be generating solutions for how our research and teaching can includ
 e a more diverse body of tacit knowledge from the urban community and how 
 can we solve real-life problems with data analytics. We will be developing
  strategies and recommending formal research frameworks (mixed-method\, mu
 lti-scale\, validating-by-interview\, etc.) to guide UA and SC research to
 wards championing citizen voices and helping people. Our goal is to empowe
 r UA students and researchers to shape urban research questions\, methodol
 ogies and implementation in way that positively impacts the city and its p
 eople.\n\nWe will have meaningful conversations and develop a guiding agen
 da that can serve as an ‘intervention’ that is needed as UA and SC fie
 lds mature. Without this discussion\, these fields may not adopt the kinds
  of sensitivities towards diversity\, inclusion and the human experience\,
  that it needs to best serve the people. The agenda will help put forth:\n
 \n- A plan to put crucial information into the hands of the city’s most 
 vulnerable populations.\n- Methods for using technology to collect data on
  spatial behaviors in a safe\, privacy-securing way\, and using the inform
 ation to optimize locations of services and facilities.\n- Designs for tec
 h education for disadvantaged and underrepresented populations at multiple
  levels.\n- Methods to identify which small changes can have the biggest i
 mpact.\n- How to listen to and learn from citizens who need help and have 
 first-hand perspectives (i.e. tacit knowledge) on the urban ecosystem.\n- 
 Open ended discussion on how to connect urban analytics to common-sense ur
 ban problems.\n\nActivities\nOur panel sessions will contain five speakers
  each\, and will include a mixture of visuals and oral presentations.\n\nB
 reakout sessions will divide our participants into 3 groups. The topics wi
 ll be formed by our set of distinguished breakout leaders and can be adjus
 ted to reflect the pressing needs of the day.\n\nPanelists\, breakout lead
 ers and the keynote & closing speakers will be announced at a later date.\

 ound\nUrban Analytics (UA) and Smart Cities (SC) degree programs are becom
 ing more common in the U.S. and globally. Often\, these programs don’t h
 ave a ‘plan’ for how technology and data analysis will tackle real wor
 ld issues\, or an understanding of how different perspectives on race\, et
 hnicity\, gender\, sexual-orientation\, disability and poverty status (and
  more) may add crucial variables to the study of urban analytics.\n\nAltho
 ugh the UA field is data-rich\, the questions and studies in this field ma
 y be ill-suited for helping cities reach the most vulnerable citizens\, or
  how to best empower UA students to positively impact to the city and its 
 people. Because these fields were founded with technocratic and engineerin
 g problem-solving ideals (values inherent to analytics and ‘smart’ end
 eavors)\, the research and thought leadership in UA ad SC lacks the voices
  and input of the typical urbanite and those most in need\, although it co
 ntributes powerful methods and draws talent.\n\nResearch Contribution\nWe 
 will be generating solutions for how our research and teaching can include
  a more diverse body of tacit knowledge from the urban community and how c
 an we solve real-life problems with data analytics? We will be developing

 ture with Professor Abigail Stewart\, who will speak on "Creating an Inclu

 s welcome to attend and enjoy a reception following the lecture!\n\nAbout 
 Abigail J. Stewart\nDr. Abigail J. Stewart is the Sandra Schwartz Tangri D
 istinguished University Professor of Psychology and Women's Studies at the
  University of Michigan. She served as director of the University of Michi
 gan ADVANCE Program\, 2001-2016\, before which she held a number of other 
 administrative positions. She holds degrees from Wesleyan University\, Lon
 don School of Economics\, and Harvard University. Her current research foc
 uses on academic and life experiences related to race\, class and gender\,
  and on political attitudes and activision.\n\nDr. Stewart's recent book\,
  with Virginia Valian\, is called An Inclusive Academy: Achieving Diversit
 y and Excellence (MIT Press\, 2018):\n\nHow colleges and universities can 
 live up to their ideals of diversity\, and why inclusivity and excellence 
 go hand in hand.\n\nMost colleges and universities embrace the ideals of d
 iversity and inclusion\, but many fall short\, especially in the hiring\, 
 retention\, and advancement of faculty who would more fully represent our 
 diverse world—in particular women and people of color. In this book\, Ab
 igail Stewart and Virginia Valian argue that diversity and excellence go h
 and in hand and provide guidance for achieving both.\n\nStewart and Valian
 \, themselves senior academics\, support their argument with comprehensive
  data from a range of disciplines. They show why merit is often overlooked
 \; they offer statistics and examples of individual experiences of exclusi
 on\, such as being left out of crucial meetings\; and they outline institu
 tional practices that keep exclusion invisible\, including reliance on pro
 xies for excellence\, such as prestige\, that disadvantage outstanding can
 didates who are not members of the white male majority.\n\nPerhaps most im
 portant\, Stewart and Valian provide practical advice for overcoming obsta
 cles to inclusion. This advice is based on their experiences at their own 
 universities\, their consultations with faculty and administrators at many
  other institutions\, and data on institutional change. Stewart and Valian
  offer recommendations for changing structures and practices so that peopl
 e become successful in ways that benefit everyone. They describe better wa
 ys of searching for job candidates\; evaluating candidates for hiring\, te
 nure\, and promotion\; helping faculty succeed\; and broadening rewards an
 d recognition.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.edu/node/633364#0

 \, Public\, Undergraduate students\nStatus: published\n\nOverheating light
 ing instruments coupled with human error are a leading cause of intraopera
 tive fires and patient burns. The healthcare system refers to these as “
 never events” so they should never happen\, right? But\, data suggests t
 hat they occur more than twice a day. This was a red flag for Jackson Medi
 cal Co-founders James Rains and Kamil Makhnejia.\n\nAt the Georgia Institu
 te of Technology\, Rains and Makhnejia began conceptualizing GloShield™ 
 to address this safety issue. They then brought on to the team Dr. Spencer
  Kozin\, a local Atlanta urologist\, who not only resonated with the safet
 y issue being addressed\, but also provided clinical expertise to the team
 .\n\nTogether\, the future Jackson Medical team knew they had a great base
  concept but to successfully commercialize the idea\, they would need an a
 dditional outside design and development perspective. “We knew that we h
 ad an innovative concept and that there is nothing like GloShield currentl
 y on the market\, but needed to ensure that we were taking the correct ste
 ps that would help us reach commercialization in a timely and cost-efficie
 nt manner\,” Rains said.\n\nProfessor Rains\, Dr. Kozin\, Mr. Makhnejia 
 will discuss the questions researchers and innovators must answer and what
  they should anticipate from a funding and development timeline standpoint
  at the earliest stages of the pathway in their medical product concept’
 s journey toward commercialization.\n\nLunch will be provided free of char
 ge for those who attend in person.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.edu/no

 classic success stories where robotic systems have demonstrated incredible
  value for the industry. In unstructured manufacturing\, the inputs of the
  system can vary significantly\, but the outputs of the system are defined
 . Food and agriculture production are examples of this type of unstructure
 d manufacturing problem\, but traditional manufacturing is also moving in 
 this direction as robotics move beyond welding and painting. This presenta
 tion will give examples of systems that integrate advanced perception and 
 control technologies into robotic systems to perform complex tasks like cu

 \nComposite Materials: The growing pains of a "young technology" destined 
 for a very bright future\n\nComposites are a young and unique class of mat
 erials that provide engineering freedom and integration of parts and funct
 ions. In the last 30 years\, composites have evolved from niche to mainstr
 eam thanks to major advances in chemistry\, material science and automatio
 n. However\, the industry is still not extracting the full potential of th
 e technology to maximize performance\, increase production rates and reduc
 e total cost of ownership. The future widespread adoption of composites ac
 ross multiple markets will be driven by innovations in high throughput man
 ufacturing\, multi-functionality\, environmental sustainability\, simulati
 on and modelling.\n\nDate: Friday\, April 17th\nTime: 11AM – 12:15 PM (l

 rof. Marilyn Smith]\n\nwill defend a doctoral thesis entitled\,\n\nA Refin
 ed Potential Theory for the Incompressible Unsteady Subcritical-Reynolds n
 umber Flows on Canonical Bluff Bodies\n\nOn\n\nTuesday\, May 5 at 2:00 p.m
 .\nBluejeans: [1]\n\nAbstract\n\nClassical potential theory falls short of
  reconciling the actions of fluid viscosity and frictional forces in an ac
 tual flow with the theoretical analysis of such a flow. As such\, it is un
 able to predict the important phenomenon of flow separation that leads\, i
 n part\, to the pressure drag experienced by the body in an actual flow. H
 owever\, analytical solutions that theories provide offer huge advantages 
 over numerical and experimental solutions in the understanding of fluid fl
 ows and in design. These are in terms of cost and time consumption.\n\nThe
 refore\, a refinement of Classical potential theory of the flow over a cir
 cular cylinder was carried out to bridge this gap. It was achieved by intr
 oducing a viscous sink-source-vortex sheet on the surface of the cylinder.
  These singularities are modeled as concentric at every location. The vort
 ices are modeled as Burgers vortices\, and analytic expressions for their 
 strengths and those of the sinks/sources are obtained from the classical t
 heory. These are employed to obtain a Reynolds-number-and-time-dependent s
 tream function that captures important qualitative features of the flow. A
  viscous potential function that satisfies the governing equations is then
  derived. It is obtained by defining the viscous stream function on a prin
 cipal axis of the flow about which the vorticity vector is identically zer
 o. Strategies have also been developed to account for the finite extent of
  the cylinder\, to introduce dynamic unsteadiness\, to predict separation/
 reattachment/transition\, to obtain forces\, and to apply the solution to 
 an arbitrary geometry with a focus on spheres and spheroids.\n\nThe refine
 d potential theory was verified against experimental and numerical data on
  the cylinder in an incompressible crossflow at. Its drag prediction is wi
 thin the error bound of measured data. The prediction of other quantities 
 is also within acceptable ranges. Its prediction of the force coefficients
  over the range was validated against experimental data on the cylinder in
  crossflow. There is a good agreement in the trend with slight disparity i
 n magnitude that is in favor of safety for design purposes. The energy spe
 ctra of the wake velocity display the Kolmogorov's Five-Thirds law of homo
 geneous isotropic turbulence. This verifies and validates the unsteadiness
  in refined potential theory as turbulent in nature.\n\nCommittee\n\n- Pro

 healthy\, outbreak\, epidemics\, pandemics\, and recovery - will be highli
 ghted.\n\nThe focus will be on critical and essential supply chains to dem
 onstrate the capital importance of supply chains in fighting and surviving
  a pandemics\, as revealed by the COVID-19 crisis.\n\n- Critical supply ch
 ains support the fight against the pandemic disease by supporting the boom
 ing demand for testing kits\, masks\, respirators\, etc.\, to hospitals an
 d health centers.\n- Essential supply chains provide the food\, health pro
 ducts and goods necessary to ensure survival\, quality of life and recover
 y capability of pandemic-affected populations and economies\, notably subj
 ect to distancing and containment measures.\n\nKey avenues for collectivel
 y and comprehensively enabling effective and efficient pandemic supply cha
 in readiness and response in each of the world states will be presented. T
 hese avenues combine common-sense pragmatic practices to leading-edge conc
 epts and technologies\, notably based on Artificial Intelligence and the P
 hysical Internet. They notably enable:\n\n- Critical and essential supply 
 chain visibility and predictability\;\n- Smart fair decisions relative to 
 critical and essential product allocation\, deployment\, and transportatio
 n\;\n- Keeping a healthy and efficient supply chain workforce\;\n- Repurpo
 sing supply chains and facilities to provide boost in critical and essenti
 al product availability\;\n- Vector-free logistics eliminating disease pro
 pagation through goods and food production\, packaging\, distribution and 
 delivery.\n\nThe presentation results from the interdisciplinary collabora

 nWhat Is Juneteenth?\nThis story by Elixabeth Nix was originally published
  on History.com. [5] The story has been adapted for the College of Science
 s.\n\nJuneteenth (short for "June Nineteenth") marks the day when federal 
 troops arrived in Galveston\, Texas in 1865 to take control of the state a
 nd ensure that all enslaved people be freed. The troops' arrival came a fu
 ll two and a half years after signing the Emancipation Proclamation. Junet
 eenth honors the end to slavery in the United States and is considered the
  longest-running African American holiday.\n\nConfederate General Robert E
 . Lee had surrendered at Appomattox Court House two months earlier in Virg
 inia\, but slavery had remained relatively unaffected in Texas - until U.S
 . General Gordon Granger stood on Texas soil and read General Orders No. 3
 : "The people of Texas are informed that\, in accordance with a proclamati
 on from the Executive of the United States\, all slaves are free."\n\nRead

 le constituents. This course will focus on conceptual and modeling skills 
 to understand and effectively manage supply chains and operations from a s
 ystems perspective. Models will address system characteristics (e.g.\, dem
 and dependencies) that drive system dynamics and policies to regulate perf
 ormance. Course topics include methods for improving coordination and coll
 aboration\, addressing demand dependencies\, and reliably measuring and ev
 aluating system performance.\n\nWho Should Attend\nThis course is designed
  for representatives from governmental or non-governmental organizations\,

 ons of an organization\, logistics and supply chain managers\, program man
 agers\, directors of field operations\, directors of emergency/disaster pr
 eparedness and response\, and public health professionals.\n\nHow You Will
  Benefit\n- Identify opportunities for coordination within organizations a
 nd collaboration across organizations for increased efficiency and improve
 d outcomes.\n- Describe the strategic behavior of decision-makers and the 
 impact of the market (or contract) structure on the participant's actions 
 and the overall system dynamics.\n- Define evaluation metrics in alignment
  with the system goals and structure system operations and incentives that
  address and evaluate these metrics.\n\nWhat Is Covered\n- How coordinatio
 n and collaboration can improve supply chain efficiency and effectiveness\

 agers\, directors of field operations\, directors of emergency/disaster pr
 eparedness and response\, and public health professionals.\n\nHow You Will

SUMMARY:Assistant Professor Levi Wood: Systems Analysis of Neural Immune S

DESCRIPTION:Status: unknown\n\nDysregulated neural immune activity contrib
 utes to the pathogenesis of diverse diseases\, including Alzheimer’s dis
 ease\, traumatic brain injury\, and lysosomal storage disorders\, among ot
 hers. Understanding neural immune function and identification of strategie
 s to restore healthy or homeostatic immune activity holds the potential to
  transform our ability to treat neurodegenerative diseases. Neural immune 
 activity is a complex system\, consisting of intracellular regulation of d
 iverse immune genes by phospho-signaling cascades that ultimately control 
 glial phenotypes and expression of extra-cellular signaling factors\, such
  as cytokines\, that communicate between cells and exacerbate dysfunction.
  This talk will consist of two parts.\n\nIn the first part\, I will discus
 s our work\, in collaboration with Dr. Amit Reddi\, to illuminate the role
  of the blood factors heme and hemoglobin in potentiating Alzheimer’s di
 sease pathogenesis. We have found that elevation of these factors in Alzhe
 imer’s disease suppresses immune function of the brain’s immune cells\
 , astrocytes and microglia\, including their abilities to clear amyloid be
 ta\, which is the hallmark protein that forms plaques in Alzheimer’s bra
 ins. By integrating extracellular (cytokine) and intracellular (phospho-pr
 otein) signaling data\, we have determined that heme and hemoglobin attenu
 ate normal immune function by stimulating the PI3K/Akt pathway. Moreover\,
  attenuation of the heme biosynthetic pathway reduced amyloid beta patholo
 gy in 5xFAD Alzheimer’s disease mice. Together\, these data illuminate a
 n entirely new aspect of Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis and suggest a 
 novel mechanism resulting in brain immune cell “fatigue\,” which may b
 e treated by attenuating heme synthesis.\n\nIn the second part\, I will di
 scuss our work to identify neuroinflammatory signaling responsible for cog
 nitive deficit after repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). We use
  a weight drop closed head injury mouse model relevant to sports injury in
  which a subset of mice experience cognitive deficit despite having no ove
 rt signs of neuronal injury. Using a non-invasive optical cerebral blood f
 low sensor\, we found that mice with acutely low cerebral blood flow after
  mTBI would suffer long term memory deficit and had elevated acute microgl
 ial activation. Surprisingly\, microglial activation was accompanied by ne
 uronal pro-inflammatory phospho-signaling and cytokine expression\, sugges
 ting for the first time that neural immunity and cognitive deficit depends
  on the interplay between glia and neurons. Moreover\, our ongoing studies
  suggest that inhibition of phospho-signaling using translationally releva
 nt small molecules has the potential to restore cognitive function after r
 epetitive mTBI.\n\nDr. Wood has been an assistant professor in the Institu
 te for Bioengineering and Bioscience at Georgia Tech since August 2015. He
  completed his PhD at MIT where he developed novel microfluidics to identi
 fy mechanisms governing blood vessel geometry during angiogenesis. For his
  postdoc\, Levi\, joined the signaling systems biology laboratories of Kev
 in Haigis and Douglas Lauffenburger at MGH and MIT. While there\, he used 
 engineering systems methods to identify new mechanisms of cell death in Al
 zheimer’s disease and the inflamed intestine. The Wood lab combines engi
 neering systems analysis with multi-dimensional datasets from human tissue
 s\, mouse models\, and 2D and 3D cell culture models to understand the rol
 es of neural immune activity in promoting healthy brain function and in dr
 iving diverse neurological disorders. In addition to identifying underlyin
 g mechanisms of disease\, Dr. Wood has a particular interest in identifyin
 g rapidly translatable treatment approaches using re-purposed drugs for ca
 ncer and other conditions that may already be commercially available or la
 te stage development. Dr. Wood’s areas of study include traumatic brain 
 injury\, Alzheimer’s disease\, and the lysosomal storage disorder\, muco
 lipidosis IV.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  https://www.chemistry.gatech.edu/event/assis

  you create the biology of courage. And when you choose to connect with ot
 hers under stress\, you can create resilience....Stress gives us access to
  our hearts. The compassionate heart that finds joy and meaning in connect
 ing with others\, and yes\, your pounding physical heart\, working so hard
  to give you strength and energy. And when you choose to view stress in th
 is way\, you're not just getting better at stress\, you're actually making
  a pretty profound statement. You're saying that you can trust yourself to
  handle life's challenges. And you're remembering that you don't have to f

 \, Undergraduate students\nStatus: draft\n\nThe build up of stress has con
 sequences for the mind and body. Poor sleep\, lack of appetite\, decreased
  productivity\, decreased immunity\, susceptibility to sickness\, are some
  of the few\, and we might find it difficult to get out of the vicious cyc
 le of stress. Except\, nowadays there are some very simple and effective w
 ays to nip the stress bud so we can prevent the over-growth! Come\, join\,
  and learn and try "Tapping" - a simple stress management method to add to
  your tool box. A brief introduction (and actually doing it) is all you ne
 ed so we can better Tap into calm. When: Noon ~ 12:30\, most Fridays start
 ing August 28.\nWhere: Drop In Zoom (Initial download/setup likely require
 d for phone/computer) [01]\nWhat: 1. "Tapping" similar to this video " Tra

 are not inevitable. How you think and how you act can transform your exper
 ience of stress. When you choose to view your stress response as helpful\,
  you create the biology of courage. And when you choose to connect with ot
 hers under stress\, you can create resilience....Stress gives us access to
  our hearts. The compassionate heart that finds joy and meaning in connect
 ing with others\, and yes\, your pounding physical heart\, working so hard
  to give you strength and energy. And when you choose to view stress in th
 is way\, you're not just getting better at stress\, you're actually making
  a pretty profound statement. You're saying that you can trust yourself to
  handle life's challenges. And you're remembering that you don't have to f
 ace them alone. "\n- Video: " First Aid for Emotional Distress - Trauma Ta

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Postdoc
 \, Undergraduate students\nStatus: draft\n\nThe build up of stress has con
 sequences for the mind and body. Poor sleep\, lack of appetite\, decreased
  productivity\, decreased immunity\, susceptibility to sickness\, are some
  of the few\, and we might find it difficult to get out of the vicious cyc
 le of stress. Except\, nowadays there are some very simple and effective w
 ays to nip the stress bud so we can prevent the over-growth! Come\, join\,
  and learn and try "Tapping" - a simple stress management method to add to
  your tool box. A brief introduction (and actually doing it) is all you ne
 ed so we can better Tap into calm. When: Noon ~ 12:30\, most Fridays start
 ing August 28.\nWhere: Drop In Zoom (Initial download/setup likely require
 d for phone/computer) [01]\nWhat: 1. "Tapping" similar to this video " Tra
 uma Tapping Technique [02]."\n2. Chat and Q&A (Please feel free to leave e
 arly after Tapping\, as needed\, or you are more than welcome to stay a li
 ttle longer and enjoy a Q&A and some more chat.)\n\n- Mental Health Resour

 are not inevitable. How you think and how you act can transform your exper
 ience of stress. When you choose to view your stress response as helpful\,
  you create the biology of courage. And when you choose to connect with ot
 hers under stress\, you can create resilience....Stress gives us access to
  our hearts. The compassionate heart that finds joy and meaning in connect
 ing with others\, and yes\, your pounding physical heart\, working so hard
  to give you strength and energy. And when you choose to view stress in th
 is way\, you're not just getting better at stress\, you're actually making
  a pretty profound statement. You're saying that you can trust yourself to
  handle life's challenges. And you're remembering that you don't have to f
 ace them alone. "\n- Video: " First Aid for Emotional Distress - Trauma Ta

 nJoin the BlueJeans Meeting [1]\n\nABSTRACT\nAntarctic krill (Euphausia su
 perba) is a key component of the Antarctic food web with considerable lipi
 d reserves that are vital for both their own and higher predator survival.
  Krill feed on diatoms\, dinoflagellates and other algal species year-roun
 d\, resulting in high omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids which are essent
 ial for krill health\, growth and reproduction. Krill-derived omega-3 cont
 aining products (particularly eicosapentacnoic acid (20:5w3) and docosahex
 aenoic acid (22:6w3)) are sold as nutraceuticals for human consumption. Kr
 ill oil tablets (sold as an omega-3 supplement) are now one of the fastest
  growing nutraceuticals globally. However\, few attempts have been made to
  link the spatial and temporal variations in krill lipids to those in thei
 r food supply. Knowledge of krill diet and krill lipid dynamics is lacking
  for the Indian and Pacific Oceans\, as most studies have focused on the S
 outh Atlantic Ocean sector where the krill fishery is based. Most research
  voyages are conducted during the summer and all scientific studies are re
 stricted in their spatial and temporal scales. Another major gap in curren
 t Antarctic ecosystem models is the link between environmental drivers and
  their impact on primary production and therefore food availability. Satel
 lite-derived data for biological and ecological measures is still developi
 ng as a tool although outputs such as ocean colour data which can be conve
 rted into chlorophyll a concentrations (a proxy for primary production)\, 
 are becoming more common. This seminar will cover recent developments in t
 he knowledge of spatiotemporal fluctuations of krill lipid biochemistry in
  relation to their environment.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.edu/node/

 \, Undergraduate students\nStatus: draft\n\nThe build up of stress has con
 sequences for the mind and body. Poor sleep\, lack of appetite\, decreased
  productivity\, decreased immunity\, susceptibility to sickness\, are some
  of the few\, and we might find it difficult to get out of the vicious cyc
 le of stress. Except\, nowadays there are some very simple and effective w
 ays to nip the stress bud so we can prevent the over-growth! Come\, join\,
  and learn and try "Tapping" - a simple stress management method to add to
  your tool box. A brief introduction (and actually doing it) is all you ne
 ed so we can better Tap into calm. When: Noon ~ 12:30\, most Fridays start
 ing August 28.\nWhere: Drop In Zoom (Initial download/setup likely require
 d for phone/computer) [01]\nWhat: 1. "Tapping" similar to this video " Tra
 uma Tapping Technique [02]."\n2. Chat and Q&A (Please feel free to leave e

 are not inevitable. How you think and how you act can transform your exper
 ience of stress. When you choose to view your stress response as helpful\,
  you create the biology of courage. And when you choose to connect with ot
 hers under stress\, you can create resilience....Stress gives us access to
  our hearts. The compassionate heart that finds joy and meaning in connect
 ing with others\, and yes\, your pounding physical heart\, working so hard
  to give you strength and energy. And when you choose to view stress in th
 is way\, you're not just getting better at stress\, you're actually making
  a pretty profound statement. You're saying that you can trust yourself to
  handle life's challenges. And you're remembering that you don't have to f
 ace them alone. "\n- Video: " First Aid for Emotional Distress - Trauma Ta

 ework for Fan Stage Conceptual Design Under Distortion\n\nInduced by Bound
 ary Layer Ingestion\n\nWednesday\, October 14 at 12:00 p.m.\nMeeting Link:
  [1]\n\nAbstract\nVarious tightly integrated aircraft concepts have emerge
 d as a result of aggressive performance goals set forth by various organiz
 ations. Most integrated aircraft system configurations exploit the concept
  of Boundary Layer Ingestion (BLI). While the potential benefits of BLI ar
 e huge\, several significant challenges - both on the modeling and design 
 fronts - appear due to BLI. This dissertation focuses on addressing the im
 pacts of BLI induced circumferential flow distortion on the conceptual des
 ign of a fan stage.\n\nDistortion introduces extra losses in both rotors a
 nd stators in addition to increased unsteady rotor response. In presence o
 f incidence swings\, conventional conceptual design tools are inadequate t
 o design optimal rotor blades and generate non-axisymmetric stators\, a co
 ncept that has shown promise in alleviating stage losses due to distortion
 . Besides\, concerns of structural integrity also arise for rotor blades d
 ue to the unsteady loading they experience when rotating in a distorted fl
 ow field. Parametric effects of these phenomena with varying levels of dis
 tortion are quantified\, and a significant portion of the fan stage losses
  are shown to be recoverable using the aero-structural design framework in
 troduced and developed in this dissertation.\n\nThe aerodynamic design fra
 mework is developed through several extensions to the conventionally used 
 multi-meanline method. The inclusion of additional features accounts for f
 low asymmetry\, parametric blade angle optimization\, rotor unsteady perfo
 rmance\, and non-axisymmetric stator design. The model is verified\, and e
 xperiments are performed to evaluate the effectiveness of each modeling el
 ement. Similarly\, the Variational Asymptotic Method (VAM) is proposed as 
 a computationally efficient technique to perform transient structural anal
 ysis of rotor blades. VAM is validated for a variety of loading scenarios 
 and is leveraged to demonstrate the nature of vibratory stresses and highl
 ight the concerns of resonance on a test case. The framework encapsulating
  both aerodynamic design and structural analysis is finally utilized to ex
 plore the design space to minimize vibratory stresses on the blades with a
  small trade-off in the stage efficiency. The fan stage design resulting f
 rom the framework proposed and formulated in this dissertation aims to ser
 ve as a starting point for the preliminary design of a distortion-tolerant
  fan.\n\nCommittee\n\n- Prof. Dimitri Mavris – School of Aerospace Engin

 \, Undergraduate students\nStatus: draft\n\nThe build up of stress has con
 sequences for the mind and body. Poor sleep\, lack of appetite\, decreased
  productivity\, decreased immunity\, susceptibility to sickness\, are some
  of the few\, and we might find it difficult to get out of the vicious cyc
 le of stress. Except\, nowadays there are some very simple and effective w
 ays to nip the stress bud so we can prevent the over-growth! Come\, join\,
  and learn and try "Tapping" - a simple stress management method to add to
  your tool box. A brief introduction (and actually doing it) is all you ne
 ed so we can better Tap into calm. When: Noon ~ 12:30\, most Fridays start
 ing August 28.\nWhere: Drop In Zoom (Initial download/setup likely require
 d for phone/computer) [01]\nWhat: 1. "Tapping" similar to this video " Tra
 uma Tapping Technique [02]."\n2. Chat and Q&A (Please feel free to leave e

 are not inevitable. How you think and how you act can transform your exper

  you create the biology of courage. And when you choose to connect with ot
 hers under stress\, you can create resilience....Stress gives us access to
  our hearts. The compassionate heart that finds joy and meaning in connect
 ing with others\, and yes\, your pounding physical heart\, working so hard
  to give you strength and energy. And when you choose to view stress in th
 is way\, you're not just getting better at stress\, you're actually making
  a pretty profound statement. You're saying that you can trust yourself to
  handle life's challenges. And you're remembering that you don't have to f
 ace them alone. "\n- Video: " First Aid for Emotional Distress - Trauma Ta

 \, Undergraduate students\nStatus: draft\n\nThe build up of stress has con
 sequences for the mind and body. Poor sleep\, lack of appetite\, decreased
  productivity\, decreased immunity\, susceptibility to sickness\, are some
  of the few\, and we might find it difficult to get out of the vicious cyc
 le of stress. Except\, nowadays there are some very simple and effective w
 ays to nip the stress bud so we can prevent the over-growth! Come\, join\,
  and learn and try "Tapping" - a simple stress management method to add to
  your tool box. A brief introduction (and actually doing it) is all you ne
 ed so we can better Tap into calm. When: Noon ~ 12:30\, most Fridays start
 ing August 28.\nWhere: Drop In Zoom (Initial download/setup likely require
 d for phone/computer) [01]\nWhat: 1. "Tapping" similar to this video " Tra
 uma Tapping Technique [02]."\n2. Chat and Q&A (Please feel free to leave e
 arly after Tapping\, as needed\, or you are more than welcome to stay a li
 ttle longer and enjoy a Q&A and some more chat.)\n\n- Mental Health Resour

 are not inevitable. How you think and how you act can transform your exper
 ience of stress. When you choose to view your stress response as helpful\,
  you create the biology of courage. And when you choose to connect with ot
 hers under stress\, you can create resilience....Stress gives us access to
  our hearts. The compassionate heart that finds joy and meaning in connect
 ing with others\, and yes\, your pounding physical heart\, working so hard
  to give you strength and energy. And when you choose to view stress in th
 is way\, you're not just getting better at stress\, you're actually making
  a pretty profound statement. You're saying that you can trust yourself to
  handle life's challenges. And you're remembering that you don't have to f
 ace them alone. "\n- Video: " First Aid for Emotional Distress - Trauma Ta

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Postdoc
 \, Undergraduate students\nStatus: draft\n\nThe build up of stress has con
 sequences for the mind and body. Poor sleep\, lack of appetite\, decreased
  productivity\, decreased immunity\, susceptibility to sickness\, are some
  of the few\, and we might find it difficult to get out of the vicious cyc
 le of stress. Except\, nowadays there are some very simple and effective w
 ays to nip the stress bud so we can prevent the over-growth! Come\, join\,
  and learn and try "Tapping" - a simple stress management method to add to
  your tool box. A brief introduction (and actually doing it) is all you ne
 ed so we can better Tap into calm. When: Noon ~ 12:30\, most Fridays start
 ing August 28.\nWhere: Drop In Zoom (Initial download/setup likely require
 d for phone/computer) [01]\nWhat: 1. "Tapping" similar to this video " Tra
 uma Tapping Technique [02]."\n2. Chat and Q&A (Please feel free to leave e
 arly after Tapping\, as needed\, or you are more than welcome to stay a li
 ttle longer and enjoy a Q&A and some more chat.)\n\n- Mental Health Resour

 are not inevitable. How you think and how you act can transform your exper
 ience of stress. When you choose to view your stress response as helpful\,
  you create the biology of courage. And when you choose to connect with ot
 hers under stress\, you can create resilience....Stress gives us access to
  our hearts. The compassionate heart that finds joy and meaning in connect
 ing with others\, and yes\, your pounding physical heart\, working so hard
  to give you strength and energy. And when you choose to view stress in th
 is way\, you're not just getting better at stress\, you're actually making
  a pretty profound statement. You're saying that you can trust yourself to
  handle life's challenges. And you're remembering that you don't have to f
 ace them alone. "\n- Video: " First Aid for Emotional Distress - Trauma Ta

 \, Public\, Undergraduate students\nStatus: published\n\nGordana Vunjak-No
 vakovic\, Ph.D.\nUniversity Professor\nThe Mikati Foundation Professor of 
 Biomedical Engineering and Medicine\nDirector\, Laboratory for Stem Cells 
 and Tissue Engineering\nColumbia University\n\nApproximately 35 million me
 n and women in the United States suffer from TMJ problems\, and as many as
  one in four people experience symptoms of TMJ disorders\, including pain 
 in the chewing muscles\, jaw stiffness\, clicking\, popping or grating\, o
 r the pain of arthritis. The temporomandibular joint\, or TMJ\, is the jaw
  joint that lies in front of each ear\, connecting the mandible (lower jaw
 ) to the skull\, providing the mobility necessary for biting\, chewing\, s
 wallowing food\, speaking\, and making facial expressions.\n\nGordana Vunj
 ak-Novakovic and her research team have been able to grow bone grafts that
  will match a patient’s original jaw bone for facial reconstruction surg
 ery to repair injuries\, disease\, or birth defects. This spectacular adva
 ncement in bone tissue engineering provides all the advantages of the body
 ’s original jaw bone. The team used real bone as a scaffold to grow the 
 new TMJ graft. Taking the knee joints of calves\, they stripped them of al
 l their living cells and carved them into cubic centimeter-size parts of a
  human jaw joint.\n\nUsing mesenchymal stem cells\, which can differentiat
 e into many cell types\, to seed the scaffolding\, they fed them with stre
 ams of nutrients\, growth factors\, and oxygen in a bioreactor. The next s
 tep will be to determine the best way to grow blood vessels in the bone gr
 afts to continue their viability.\n\nIn another research area\, Vunjak-Nov
 akovic is engineering thick\, vascularized\, and electromechanically funct
 ional cardiac tissue\, by culturing stem cells\, the actual “tissue engi
 neers\,” on a channeled elastomer scaffold perfused with culture medium 
 containing oxygen carriers\, to mimic blood flow. This research may lead t
 o a heart patch that could be laid over injured heart tissue to restore no
 rmal function in someone who has suffered a heart attack.\n\n“As a biome
 dical engineer actively involved in this field\, I look forward to unlocki
 ng the full regenerative potential of human stem cells\, so we can cure di
 sease and live longer than our failing organs\,” she said.\n\nHer lab ho
 sts the Bioreactor Core of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Tissue 
 Engineering Resource Center. “This sophisticated bioreactor and imaging 
 instrumentation has moved stem cell research from the ‘flat biology’ o
 f petri dishes to controllable models of high biological fidelity\, which 
 can be studied in real time to observe the interacting factors mediating s
 elf-renewal and differentiation of stem cells\,” said Vunjak-Novakovic. 
 “We now have the capacity to develop entirely new research paradigms and
  approaches to engineering human tissues.”\n\nIn 2002\, Vunjak-Novakovic
  was elected a fellow of the American Institute for Medical and Biological
  Engineering. In 2007\, she gave the Director’s lecture at the NIH\, as 
 the first woman engineer to receive this distinction. She was inducted int
 o the Women in Technology International Hall of Fame in 2008\, elected to 
 the New York Academy of Sciences in 2009\, and\, in 2010\, received the Cl
 emson Award of the Biomaterials Society for contribution to literature.\n\

 are not inevitable. How you think and how you act can transform your exper

  you create the biology of courage. And when you choose to connect with ot
 hers under stress\, you can create resilience....Stress gives us access to
  our hearts. The compassionate heart that finds joy and meaning in connect
 ing with others\, and yes\, your pounding physical heart\, working so hard
  to give you strength and energy. And when you choose to view stress in th
 is way\, you're not just getting better at stress\, you're actually making
  a pretty profound statement. You're saying that you can trust yourself to
  handle life's challenges. And you're remembering that you don't have to f

 are not inevitable. How you think and how you act can transform your exper
 ience of stress. When you choose to view your stress response as helpful\,
  you create the biology of courage. And when you choose to connect with ot
 hers under stress\, you can create resilience....Stress gives us access to
  our hearts. The compassionate heart that finds joy and meaning in connect
 ing with others\, and yes\, your pounding physical heart\, working so hard
  to give you strength and energy. And when you choose to view stress in th
 is way\, you're not just getting better at stress\, you're actually making
  a pretty profound statement. You're saying that you can trust yourself to
  handle life's challenges. And you're remembering that you don't have to f
 ace them alone. "\n- Video: " First Aid for Emotional Distress - Trauma Ta

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Postdoc
 \, Public\, Undergraduate students\nStatus: draft\n\n"What VC's are Lookin
 g For"\n\nChristopher Seabolt [1]\n\nRSVP HERE\n\nParticipation Link [2]\n
 \nChris holds approximately 30 years of venture capital and operational ex
 perience in early-stage growth companies\, most recently with T-Venture\, 
 Deutsche Telekom’s captive corporate venture capital subsidiary\, where 
 he sourced and completed numerous transactions in the technology sector in
  both the U.S. and Europe. Prior to this\, Chris was responsible for the h
 ighly successful turnaround and divestiture of Central Europe Telecom Inve
 stment (CETI) LP assets\, one of the first true venture funds in the Regio
 n. He was previously associated with the Silicon Valley office of Patricof
  & Co (now APAX Partners) as well as the in-house LBO fund of Kidder\, Pea
 body & Co. in New York. Prior positions also include CFO roles in Solvo Bi
 otechnology Rt.\, a Hungarian biotech start-up\, and Hild Real Estate Inve
 stment\, CEE’s first large-scale life annuity provider.\n\nOf almost 20 
 deals in the early-stage sector\, including a majority of Seed and Start-u
 p\, Chris has engineered successful (+money) exits for well over half of t
 hese\, with extraordinarily high returns across all managed portfolios\, p
 articularly given the extremely early stage and EU focus.\n\nChris is a fr
 equent juror and mentor in the US and EU through various accelerators and 
 start-up and seed events. His network is multinational - spanning the EU\,
  UK and the East and West Coasts of the USA.\n\nHe is an avid\, if amateur
 \, lifelong student of philosophy\, cultures and history. He is also an av
 id rider and scuba diver\, and a deliberately novice martial artist. His b
 road interests\, coupled with his ruthless training as an Economist\, tend
  to make him highly unpopular at dinner parties.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg
