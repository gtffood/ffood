DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Postdoc
 \, Undergraduate students\nStatus: draft\n\nThe build up of stress has con
 sequences for the mind and body. Poor sleep\, lack of appetite\, decreased
  productivity\, decreased immunity\, susceptibility to sickness\, are some
  of the few\, and we might find it difficult to get out of the vicious cyc
 le of stress. Except\, nowadays there are some very simple and effective w
 ays to nip the stress bud so we can prevent the over-growth! Come\, join\,
  and learn and try "Tapping" - a simple stress management method to add to
  your tool box. A brief introduction (and actually doing it) is all you ne
 ed so we can better Tap into calm. When: Noon ~ 12:30\, most Fridays start
 ing August 28.\nWhere: Drop In Zoom (Initial download/setup likely require
 d for phone/computer) [01]\nWhat: 1. "Tapping" similar to this video " Tra
 uma Tapping Technique [02]."\n2. Chat and Q&A (Please feel free to leave e
 arly after Tapping\, as needed\, or you are more than welcome to stay a li
 ttle longer and enjoy a Q&A and some more chat.)\n\n- Mental Health Resour

 ogist Kelly McGonigal\n".... the harmful effects of stress on your health 
 are not inevitable. How you think and how you act can transform your exper
 ience of stress. When you choose to view your stress response as helpful\,
  you create the biology of courage. And when you choose to connect with ot
 hers under stress\, you can create resilience....Stress gives us access to
  our hearts. The compassionate heart that finds joy and meaning in connect
 ing with others\, and yes\, your pounding physical heart\, working so hard
  to give you strength and energy. And when you choose to view stress in th
 is way\, you're not just getting better at stress\, you're actually making
  a pretty profound statement. You're saying that you can trust yourself to
  handle life's challenges. And you're remembering that you don't have to f
 ace them alone. "\n- Video: " First Aid for Emotional Distress - Trauma Ta

 actitioner. Joining the Tapping session does not constitute a professional

  Prof. Mavris)\n\nwill defend a doctoral thesis entitled\,\n\nStructural A
 nalysis and Optimization of Aircraft Wings Through Dimensional Reduction\n
 \nOn\n\nTuesday\, December 15\, 2020 at 9:00 a.m.\n[1]\n\nAbstract\nFedera
 l Aviation Regulations (FARs) are critical drivers of aircraft design. Ear
 ly-stage aircraft design involves a tight coupling between structural dyna
 mics\, aerodynamics\, and flight mechanics\, with time-dependent loads ari
 sing from the considerations of the FARs. The current state-of-the-art dec
 ouples the time-domain simulation from the structural failure computation 
 due to high computational costs associated with time-domain structural fai
 lure computation. The need to account for the dynamic loads specified by t
 he FARs while simultaneously achieving low structural weight for fuel effi
 ciency in early-stage aircraft design motivates the following question: Ho
 w to enable computationally efficient structural analysis and optimization
  of early-stage aircraft wing design\, considering dynamics?\n\nExisting m
 ethods simplify the dynamic loads to equivalent static ones and design the
  structure using shell-based analysis. Other literature approaches use com
 putationally efficient beam models for structural sizing but make assumpti
 ons on the geometry and/or material distribution. Higher-order beam theori
 es for structural analysis have been successfully applied to the design of
  slender structures subjected to time-dependent loads\, like rotorcraft bl
 ades. While aircraft wings can be considered slender structures\, aperiodi
 city\, and inhomogeneity along the span render beam theory ineffective.\n\
 nThe present work aims to bridge this gap by proposing a method for analyz
 ing 3-D structures through dimensional reduction. The use of the Variation
 al Asymptotic Method (VAM) is explored for the systematic reduction of 3-D
  structures to 1-D models and further\, recover 3-D stresses and strains a
 fter solving the 1-D problem.\n\nA stiffness matching approach is proposed
  to dimensionally reduce 3-D features such as stiffeners by locally smeari
 ng them on the base plate. The proposed method allows for stiffeners of va
 rying dimensions\, topology\, and spacing to be smeared. The stiffness mat
 ching further allows the beam cross-sectional properties computed from VAM
  to be equal to a box-beam cross-section. The equivalence enables the use 
 of Euler-Bernoulli type analytical stiffness computation while retaining t
 he accuracy of VAM. Analytical expressions allow for rapid evaluation of t
 he beam properties and stress recovery and further permit the use of Autom
 atic Differentiation (AD) to obtain partial derivatives. The proposed stru
 ctural analysis method is applied to the wing structural analysis of a nov
 el distributed electric propulsion aircraft- NASA's PEGASUS concept\, and 
 the open-source CRM.\n\nA general adjoint method for dynamic simulations i
 s presented and applied to a nonlinear Timoshenko beam theory. It combines
  general beam residual equations with an adjoint method to extract gradien
 t information from the load time-history. Aggregated constraints implement
 ed for sizing are stress-based\, combining axial stresses at the beam corn
 ers with shear stresses from torsion and external loads at both corners an
 d mid-sections. CasASDi\, an open-source tool for nonlinear optimization a
 nd algorithmic differentiation\, is used to generate expressions and calcu
 late derivatives for the relevant equations used for analysis and optimiza
 tion. Numerical tests are conducted to test the accuracy of the adjoint co
 mputations and scalability as the number of design variables increase. A s
 tructural optimization framework is developed for the beam-based dynamic a
 nalysis method presented\, allowing for the structure's sizing under stren
 gth-based failure considerations. The PEGASUS concept is used as a testbed
  to demonstrate the sizing capabilities. The structure is sized for FARs s
 pecified maneuver loads– static 2.5g and -1.0g\, and dynamic gusts.\n\nF
 indings show that: 1) the use of VAM allows for the systematic extraction 
 of beam properties for aircraft wings\, 2) the displacement and stress res
 ponse of the aircraft using beam models match reasonably well against thos
 e produced by shell-based models\, 3) for dynamic simulations\, the derive
 d adjoint method computes accurate gradients efficiently to be used in str
 uctural optimization\, 4) sizing of aircraft wings for FARs specified mane
 uvers using the proposed approach produces a 6% error compared to the shel
 l-based method\, but with a 7.8x speed-up.\n\nThe proposed approach provid
 es improvements on the existing literature methods- it is computationally 
 efficient\, provides reasonable accuracy for early-stage structural sizing
  and weight prediction\, and includes dynamic effects. The computational e
 fficiency makes it well-suited for many-query applications like optimizati
 on\, uncertainty quantification\, and generating data for surrogate modeli
 ng.\n\nCommittee\n\n- Prof. Dimitri N. Mavris – School of Aerospace Engi

 tructured Environments"\n\nAbstract: Robotic systems have traditional been
  very successful in performing tasks where the inputs are well defined and
  known in advance. Automotive and electronic manufacturing are the classic
  success stories where robotic systems have demonstrated incredible value 
 for the industry. The tasks performed by the robots almost exclusively inv
 olve the manipulation or interacting with objects whose physical propertie
 s are known a priori and the objects are rigid and dry. In the many manufa
 cturing sectors\, robotic systems must be able to work in an unstructured 
 environment where every product is unique\, deformable and even wet. This 
 presentation will discuss various approaches to enable autonomous solution
 s to these problems. This will include software to minimize manual program
 ming of robots as well systems that integrate advanced perception and cont
 rol technologies to perform complex tasks like cutting\, grasping\, and ma
 nipulation.\n\nBio: Gary McMurray is a Principal Research Engineer and Div
 ision Chief for the Intelligent Sustainable Technologies Division at the G
 eorgia Tech Research Institute. He is also an Associate Director for the I
 nstitute for Robotics and Intelligent Machines (IRIM) at Georgia Tech. IRI
 M serves as an umbrella under which robotics researchers\, educators\, and
  students from across campus can come together to advance the many high-po
 wered and diverse robotics activities at Georgia Tech. The Intelligent Sus
 tainable Technologies Division conducts innovative research to improve the
  human condition through transforming the agricultural and food systems\, 
 sustainable use and access to energy and water\, and safety of people at w
 ork and from pandemics. Mr. McMurray’s research has focused on the devel
 opment of robotic technologies and solutions for the manufacturing and agr
 ibusiness communities\, including the protein and the fruit and vegetable 
 industries. He is an expert in visual servoing – the use of vision for t
 he real-time control of robotics\, and the author of over 50-refereed tech
 nical papers and journal publications in robotics.\n\nMr. McMurray serves 
 on the advisory board for Advanced Animal Systems for the Foundation of Fo
 od and Agricultural Research. He also serves on the Board of Directors for
  the Robotics Industry Association.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.edu/n

SUMMARY:Scheller Lunchtime Live: Tesla and the Transformation of the Autom

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Postdoc
 \, Public\, Undergraduate students\nStatus: published\n\nScheller Lunchtim
 e Live is a livestream series hosted by the Georgia Tech Scheller College 
 of Business featuring faculty\, student\, and alumni speakers discussing r
 elevant topics for the tech-driven\, digital age.\n\nFew took notice when 
 a fledgling electric-vehicle startup with a brash Elon Musk as CEO went pu
 blic in the summer of 2010 at a valuation of $2.24 billion. Fast forward t
 o early 2021\, and Tesla is valued at some $800 trillion\, which marks an 
 appreciation of roughly 36\,000%. Although Tesla made only 500\,000 vehicl
 es in 2020\, it is more valuable than the legacy carmakers such as Toyota\
 , Volkswagen\, GM\, and Ford combined\, producing over 25 million cars in 
 the same year. What is more\, most major car companies are now fully commi
 tted to an all-electric future. How did Tesla accomplish such a dramatic i
 ndustry transformation? How will it play out? How long will it take? What 
 sectors will be affected by the mobility transformation? Who are the winne
 rs\, and who are the losers? And\, perhaps most important\, what does this
  mean for you personally and professionally?\n\nJust hit "Attend event" on
  the LinkedIn event and visit the Georgia Tech Scheller College of Busines
 s page on Friday\, March 5 at 12:00 p.m. ET to access the session.\n\nAbou
 t Frank T. Rothaermel\n\nFrank T. Rothaermel is a Professor of Strategy & 
 Innovation\, holds the Russell and Nancy McDonough Chair in the Scheller C
 ollege of Business at Georgia Tech\, and is an Alfred P. Sloan Industry St
 udies Fellow. Bloomberg Businessweek named Frank one of Georgia Tech’s P
 rominent Faculty\, while Poets & Quants selected Frank as one of the “Fa
 vorite Business School Professors Teaching MBAs.” The Kauffman Foundatio
 n views Frank as one of the world’s 75 thought leaders in entrepreneursh
 ip and innovation. Based on having published papers in the top 1% based on
  citations\, Thomson Reuters identified Frank as one of the “world’s m
 ost influential scientific minds.”\n\nFrank is also the author of a lead
 ing textbook—Strategic Management (5 th edition published in 2020\; tran
 slations: Greek\, Korean\, Mandarin\, and Spanish). Frank also authored ov
 er 50 case studies distributed by Harvard Business Publishing (HBP). Ninet
 een of his case studies are “Most Popular\,” indicating bestseller sta
 tus\, among the cases distributed by HBP\, including his Tesla case.\n\nLi

 cientist\n- Ian Sarad - Senior Bioprocessing Application Scientist\n\nPers
 onalized medicine in cell and gene therapy has moved therapeutics developm
 ent back to small scale bioreactors and added new process constraints: cos
 t and form factor. SBI has developed technologies that overcome these chal
 lenges and allow researchers to collect real-time sensing data with non-in
 vasive\, biocompatible\, sterilizable sensors.\n\nWe will also present our
  new fiber optic sensor platform that allows for sensing measurements insi
 de a bioreactor at multiple locatins in a perfusion flow loop upstream or 
 downstream of the bioreactor. This mapping can reveal stagnation zones\, i
 nsufficient mixing and other process improvement opportunities.\n\nWhile o
 vercoming form factor limitations is highly beneficial for personalized me
 dicine applications\, multi-sensing platforms are also critical in bioproc
 essing and in increasing reproducibility\, reducing cost\, and resulting i
 n better cell outcomes. We welcome the CMaT community to this presentation
  and offer evaluations of our technology to the CMaT researchers to encour
 age collaborations and help accelerate the development and commercializati
 on of cell therapies.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.edu/node/645412#0\n

 e transdisciplinary approaches to Fresh Supply Chain and Logistics Problem
 s via Operations Research\, GIS and Strategic Management. These fresh supp
 ly chain frameworks help build market deployment roadmaps\, hub location i
 n local supply chains and sustainable logistics strategies. Our study help
 s to provide solution approaches that are directly implementable in Indust
 ry.\n\nChapter 1:\n\nIn Chapter 1\, we address the increasing corporate pr
 essure to be environmentally sustainable. Fresh supply chains face special
  considerations with decay and loss of quality in perishable products that
  can occur in transit. We provide a logistics framework that both supplier
 s and purchasers can utilize to improve the sustainability of their supply
  chain. We employ customer segmentation\, decay & quality modeling\, and l
 ife cycle analysis (LCA) to help companies rethink their logistics strateg
 ies to better align with environmentally sustainable practice. In this cha
 pter\, we apply our framework to case studies concerning fresh cut flowers
  and quick service restaurants.\n\nChapter 2:\n\nIn Chapter 2\, we propose
  a market deployment framework which outlines a company’s dynamic expans
 ion plan. We build a complementary solution approach that is made up of Ex
 ecutive Factors\, Market Ranking\, Optimization and Heuristic Models with 
 Dynamic Capabilities. This framework results in a series of alternative so
 lution roadmaps that identify which markets should be deployed in each tim
 e phase over a given time horizon. We apply our framework to a case study 
 of a platform which enables local food supply chains by connecting farmers
  directly to restaurants.\n\nChapter 3:\n\nIn Chapter 3\, we provide a Hyb
 rid OR & GIS methodological framework to the Dynamic (Mobile) Hub Location
  Problem in the context of a small-scale local food supply chain network. 
 In our hybrid approach\, we formulate our network as a p-hub median proble
 m alongside the use of Kernel Density Analysis for hub placement in the ne
 twork in the case of p = 1. We evaluate our hub effectiveness through a co
 mparison between historical distribution flows (without a mobile hub)\, ex
 pected stagnant hub routes and expected mobile hub routes (both via TSP He
 uristics utilizing real road distance).\n\nSincerely\,\n\nIsabella Sanders

 1 2:00 pm EDT\n\nLocation: [1]\n\nA physical model of a Burgers vortex was
  created in the laboratory with characteristics corresponding to dissipati
 ve-scale eddies that copepods are likely to encounter in turbulent flows. 
 Tomographic particle image velocimetry (PIV) experiments quantified the ve
 locity field of vortices to target the small-scale structure of turbulent 
 flows corresponding to dissipation rates of 0.002 to 0.25 cm2/s3. The swim
 ming behavior of three marine copepod species is assessed as a function of
  vortex strength (and size) in and around the flow structure with the vort
 ex axis aligned vertically and horizontally in the water. The studied spec
 ies are Acartia tonsa\, an estuarine copepod with a hop-sink swimming styl
 e\; Temora longicornis\, a coastal copepod with a cruise swimming style\; 
 and Calanus finmarchicus\, an open ocean copepod with a cruise-sink swimmi
 ng style. The results show that copepods change their swimming behavior wi
 th the intensity of the Burgers vortex and reveal species-specific respons
 es in nearly all kinematic parameters. A. tonsa and C. finmarchicus exhibi
 ted the strongest behavioral response to increasing vortex strength and T.
  longicornis exhibited the weakest response. A. tonsa and T. longicornis s
 howed no response to changes in vortex orientation\, whereas C. finmarchic
 us revealed some orientation dependence. One common behavior among the spe
 cies is that the swimming trajectory shape becomes increasingly curved and
  spiral around the vortex core with increasing vortex strength\, which pro
 vides a means of local aggregation and increased encounter rate with food 
 and mates. The results are interpreted in relation to differences in swimm
 ing style and setal morphology among the species. The results provide insi
 ght to the habitats in which the copepods live as well as their vertical d
 istribution in the water column relative to turbulence intensity. This com
 parative study between species highlights that variations in turbulence in
 tensity in the ocean can influence the dynamics of copepods and the ecolog
 y of marine species.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.edu/node/646166#0\n[

 t McKinley Dirksen United States Courthouse in Chicago built in 1964 is ar
 guably one of the most significant buildings in the history of judicial ar
 chitecture in the U.S. and abroad because of its transformative role in th
 e formulation of the conventions underlying contemporary courthouse design
 . Archived at the Museum of Modern Art New York (MoMA)\, a significant res
 ource associated with the design of the courthouse is the extensive docume
 ntation of the design process at the office of Mies. This body of work con
 sists of 135 sketches\, diagrams and drawings\, features alternative solut
 ions\, variational schemes\, and sectional innovations\, and provides an u
 ntapped resource to allow a closer look in the expressive range of the arc
 hitectural language and the technical innovations proposed by one of the g
 reatest architects of the twentieth century.\n\nThe work here takes on the
  Mies Archive and presents a formal reconstruction and automated completio
 n of the preliminary representations materializing the unrealized possibil
 ities embodied in the works. More specifically\, a generative description 
 of Mies’ courthouse design language is presented in the form of a shape 
 grammar implemented in the Shape Machine\, a pioneering recursive shape-re
 write technology developed at the Shape Computation Lab at the Georgia Ins
 titute of Technology. The grammar is proposed as an open-ended set of shap
 e rules that is readily expanded to complete the sets of design variations
  documented in the archive\, along with several possible ones that can be 
 in principle generated by the evolving grammar. Significantly\, all new sh
 ape rules are introduced seamlessly\, as an intrinsic part of the design p
 rocess of the evolving grammar\, without requiring reformatting of existin
 g rules or advocating the design of a singular Miesian grammar.\n\nThe wor
 k aims to provide (a) a generative model of Mies’ courthouse design lang
 uage\; (b) an automated completion of some of the rudimentary sketches\, d
 iagrams and drawings in the Mies Archive at MoMA\; (c) a prototype of an i
 nteractive design system for courthouse design that architects\, designers
  and stakeholders of courthouse architecture can evaluate for practical us
 e\; and (d) some speculations on the transformative role of the proposed c
 omputational method in bridging the gap between sketching and drafting in 
 the digital workflows of architects and designers.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://

 Evolutionary Transitions in Individuality (ETIs) describe the history of t
 he increasing complexity of life and the emergence of hierarchical organiz
 ation in an elegant framework. Each transition is characterized by a group
  of independent individuals coming together and forming a group that event
 ually can undergo Darwinian evolution and turns into a new individual leve
 l. One of the prominent examples of ETIs is the emergence of multicellular
 ity. In this thesis\, I address two key questions about the transition to 
 multicellularity: The emergence of heritability of higher-level traits and
  its relationship to cell-level traits. First\, I discuss how the heritabi
 lity of newly-formed group traits emerges as groups emerge. We introduce a
  simple theoretical model for calculating group-level trait heritability\,
  where the trait is the linear function of a cell-level trait. For cases i
 n which the relationship is more complex than a linear function\, we devel
 oped a statistical simulation to model and explore different kinds of anal
 ytical functions based on biological examples of relationship between cell
 -level traits and collective-level traits. Finally\, using the snowflake y
 east model system we did an experiment that shows an ecologically relevant
 \, emergent trait in a nascent multicellular organism can have a higher he
 ritability across a range of conditions than the unicellular-level trait o
 n which it is based. The evolution of complex multicellularity presents an
  apparent paradox: nascent multicellular organisms are thought to require 
 (relatively) large size to evolve complex traits\, but at the same time ma
 intaining large size requires complex organization at the cell and group l
 evels. This poses a chicken and egg problem between large size and cellula
 r development. Here\, we show that over the course of a year snowflake yea
 st can increase its size multiple orders of magnitude with minimal change 
 at the cell level by taking advantage of the physical properties of granul
 ar entangled materials. These results suggest that in the same way that ph
 ysically imposed geometric constraints can limit the size of clusters\, an
 -other innovations can lead to the emergence of a new biophysical mechanis
 m that changes the material properties of the clusters.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  ht

 tion Abstract:\n\nShape grammar interpreters have been studied for more th
 an forty years addressing several areas of design research including archi
 tectural\, engineering\, and product design. At the core of all these impl
 ementations\, the operation of embedding – the ability of a shape gramma
 r interpreter to search for subshapes in a geometry model even if they are
  not explicitly encoded in the database of the system – resists a genera
 l solution. It is suggested here that beyond a seemingly long list of tech
 nological hurdles\, the implementation of shape embedding\, that is\, the 
 implementation of the mathematical concept of the “part relation” betw
 een two shapes\, or equivalently\, between two drawings\, or between a sha
 pe and a design\, is the single major obstacle to take on.\n\nThis researc
 h identifies five challenges underlying the implementation of shape embedd
 ing and shape grammar interpreters at large: 1) complex entanglement of th
 e calculations required for shape embedding and a shape grammar interprete
 r at large\, with those required by a CAD system for modeling and modifyin
 g geometry\; 2) accumulated errors caused by the modeling processes of CAD
  systems\; 3) accumulated errors caused by the complex calculations requir
 ed for the derivation of affine\, and mostly\, perspectival transformation
 s\; 4) limited support for indeterminate shape embedding\; 5) low performa
 nce of the current shape embedding algorithms for models consisting of a l
 arge number of shapes.\n\nThe dissertation aims to provide a comprehensive
  engineering solution to all these five challenges above. More specificall
 y\, the five contributions of the dissertation are: 1) a new architecture 
 to separate the calculations required for the shape embedding and replacem
 ent (appropriately called here Shape Machine) vs. the calculations require
 d by a CAD system for the selection\, instantiation\, transformation\, and
  combination of shapes in CAD modeling\; 2) a new modeling calibration sys
 tem to ensure the effective translation of geometrical types of shapes to 
 their maximal representations without cumulative calculating errors\; 3) a
  new dual-mode system of the derivation of transformations for shape embed
 ding\, including a geometric approach next to the known algebraic one\, to
  implement the shape embedding relation under the full spectrum of linear 
 transformations without the accumulated errors caused by the current algor
 ithms\; 4) a new multi-step mechanism that resolves all cases of indetermi
 nate embeddings for shapes having fewer registration points than those req
 uired for a shape embedding under a particular type of transformation\; an
 d 5) a new data representation for hyperplane intersections\, the registra
 tion point signature\, to allow for the effective calculation of shape emb
 eddings for complex drawings consisting of a large number of shapes. All m
 odules are integrated into a common computational framework to test the mo
 del for a particular type of shapes – the shapes consisting of lines in 
 the Euclidean plane in the algebra U 12.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.

 e State Performance using Time-varying Functional Connectivity Methods.\n\
 nAbstract:\n\nTo successfully achieve our goals and perform optimally in m
 any tasks\, we need to control our attention and sustain it. Some people t
 hink of attention as a light switch – it’s either on or off\, but a be
 tter metaphor is to equate attention to a candle that flickers –even whe
 n it is lit\, its flame varies. This is reflected in subjective accounts o
 f people claiming to feel focused or “in the zone” from one moment to 
 being “zoned-out” in another. Early studies of sustained attention usi
 ng fMRI compute correlation across the duration of the scan for regions of
  the brain which can last from minutes up to an hour. This assumption is p
 roblematic because like a flickering candle\, researchers have found evide
 nce of moment-to-moment fluctuations in the neural systems of attention (C
 hang & Glover\, 2010\; Majeed et al.\, 2011\; Liu & Dyun\, 2013). As a res
 ult\, there has been contradictive studies claiming that large-scale netwo
 rks like default mode network (DMN) and task positive network (TPN) can bo
 th support and be detrimental to performance.\n\nTo tackle this limitation
 \, this study will employ two methods of time-varying functional connectiv
 ity\, co-activation patterns (CAPs) and quasi periodic-pattern (QPP) to ex
 amine the interaction between the large-scale brain networks that are invo
 lved in zone state performance during a finger tapping task. The first lev
 el of analysis\, using CAPs\, aims to investigate moment-to-moment fluctua
 tions in the attention networks within an individual. The main prediction 
 is that there will be certain brain states that are more prevalent in in-t
 he-zone epochs and others that are more prevalent in out-of-the-zone epoch
 s. The second level analysis\, using QPP\, seeks to identify differences i
 n stable performance versus unstable performance across time within an ind
 ividual. I hypothesize that DMN and the TPN will be more anti-correlated i
 n in-the-zone runs than out-of-the-zone runs within a subject.\n\nIf the r
 esults are as predicted\, it elucidates how inter-regional functional conn
 ectivity supports sustained attention within an individual. This can lead 
 us to a better neural mechanistic understanding of what facilitates attent
 ion in order to achieve better performance.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gate

 ght/Guggenheim 317 and on BlueJeans: [1]\n\nAbstract\nThe majority of syst
 ems in nature have a spatio-temporal dependence and can be described by Pa
 rtial Differential Equations (PDEs). They are ubiquitous in science and en
 gineering\, and are of rising interest among the control\, robotics\, and 
 machine learning communities. Related methods usually treat these infinite
  dimensional problems in finite dimensions with reduced order models. This
  leads to committing to specific approximation schemes and the subsequent 
 control laws cannot generalize outside of the approximation schemes. Addit
 ionally\, related work does not consider spatio-temporal descriptions of n
 oise that realistically represent the stochastic nature of physical system
 s. This thesis develops a variety of approaches for control optimization a
 nd co-design optimization for PDE and stochastic PDE (SPDE) systems from a
  unified perspective that can be applied to macroscopic systems in robotic
 s and fluid dynamics\, as well as microscopic systems in quantum mechanics
 . These approaches are each developed completely in the infinite dimension
 al Hilbert spaces where the systems are mathematically described\, enablin
 g the frameworks to be agnostic to the discretization scheme used to imple
 ment them. The first three developed approaches are applied in simulation 
 to classical systems in fluid mechanics such as the Heat and Burgers equat
 ion. The fourth approach is developed for second-order SPDEs that arise in
  robotic systems\, and are applied in simulation to systems in soft-roboti
 cs such as the Euler-Bernoulli equation and a biological model of a soft-r
 obotic limb. Finally\, several approaches are developed in the context of 
 quantum feedback control of open quantum systems with non-demolition measu
 rement\, and one such approach is applied in simulation to perform explici
 t feedback control of the two qubit open quantum system.\n\nCommittee\n\n-

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Public\
 , Undergraduate students\nStatus: published\n\nAvani Gupta\n[Advisor: Prof
 . Lakshmi Sankar]\n\nwill defend a doctoral thesis entitled\n\nApplication
  of an Extended Messinger Model for Ice Accretion on Complex Geometries\n\
 nOn\n\nThursday\, September 23 at 1 PM\n\nMontgomery Knight 317\n\nhttps:/
 /bluejeans.com/568440634/5222\n\nAbstract\nIce accretion can significantly
  degrade the performance\, stability\, availability\, and affordability of
  an airborne vehicle. It is imperative that this phenomenon be modeled acc
 urately. While ice accretion studies have been performed on airplane wings
 \, propellers\, and helicopter blades\, there are very few attempts to mod
 el the process on more complex geometries such as fuselages. In this study
 \, an existing in-house Extended Messinger methodology is generalized for 
 complex geometries by modeling the flow field and water droplet transport 
 on unstructured grids\, and carrying out the ice accretion calculations al
 ong surface streamlines.\n\nA general framework has been developed\, allow
 ing the use of two-dimensional and three-dimensional\, structured\, and un
 structured\, public domain and commercial CFD analyses. The methodology is
  primarily spilt into three steps: the continuum flow field analysis\, the
  dispersed water phase computations\, and the ice accretion module. In the
  present study\, in-house methodologies as well as commercial solvers such
  as STAR-CCM+ and ANSYS Fluent have been used for the flow field and dropl
 et dispersed phase computations. The in-house methodologies for the disper
 sed water droplet transport are done using an Eulerian approach\, with a o
 ne-way interaction between the air flow and the dispersed phase via the dr
 ag force exerted on the droplets by the air flow. The ice accretion is car
 ried out along surface streamlines\, or optionally along two-dimensional s
 ection cuts\, using an in-house icing methodology based on the Extended-Me
 ssinger model.\n\nThe predictions from the present approach are compared t
 o available experimental data\, and predictions using other solvers such a
 s LEWICE and STAR-CCM+. Several configurations with varying levels of comp
 lexity are modeled. These include 2-D airfoils\, swept wings\, and helicop
 ter fuselage configurations. Time and space sensitivity studies have been 
 done.\n\nCommittee\n\n- Prof. Lakshmi Sankar – School of Aerospace Engin

 eeting ID: 902 753 700 2\n\nThe evolution of complex aerospace vehicles tr
 aced with the progression of novel missions and state of the art technolog
 y has forged a continuous need for adapted or new vehicles. This sequence 
 introduces more uncertainties into the process of design. With more source
 s and unknowns\, the uncertainty of early design decision-making becomes l
 ess distinguishable and difficult to address. A matter of reducing and mit
 igating risks due to these uncertainties is a significant complication in 
 requirements definition and conceptual design phases for novel vehicle def
 initions. The inaccessibility and inapplicable nature of historical data\,
  along with sparsity of experts for each next generation of vehicles\, mak
 es this task even harder. This leaves the industry with a gap in managing 
 the compounding uncertainties in setting performance constraints and risk 
 mitigation strategies without accessible data or expertise.\n\nA prime exa
 mple of lessons learned can be found in the Space Transportation System Ve
 hicle (STS-1). The program required significant risk mitigation when the a
 erodynamic loading on the wings of the orbiter introduced 30-40% higher st
 ructural loads than designed to withstand. Since then\, the field of desig
 n has evolved significantly into the state-of-the-art multidisciplinary de
 sign and integrated modeling and simulation methods. The basis the existin
 g conceptual design process sets enables uncertainty reduction through kno
 wledge of performance and quantitative decision-making.\n\nTo address the 
 aspects of uncertainty often overlooked or ignored\, this research propose
 s an augmentation of the existing conceptual design environment. The focus
  will be to enable uncertainty characterization of the design assumptions\
 , and modeling qualities\, for uncertainty-informed risk mitigation that r
 educes the risks of rework due to variation in the design and under-predic
 ted phenomena from reduced modeling approximations. The methodology propos
 ed within this research hypothesizes an uncertainty threshold scenario-bas
 ed approach for dependent performance enveloping and margin allocation. It
  is proposed to demonstrate this method on the case study of approximating
  the dynamic modal deflections of a publicly available Launch Vehicle mode
 l under the approximation between low-fidelity dynamics and full-scale fle
 xible body dynamics.\n\n- Prof. Dimitri Mavris – School of Aerospace Eng

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Public\, Undergraduate stud
 ents\nExtras: Free food\nStatus: published\n\nRSVP now to attend "National
 ist Backlash Against Foreign Climate Shaming" with Dr. Umberto Mignozzetti
  [1]. Mignozetti is a Visiting Assistant Professor at Emory University in 
 the Quantitative Theory and Methods Department. The event will be both in-
 person and online via BlueJeans. For in-person attendees\, a meal will be 
 provided. Due to the capacity of the room\, only 20 in-person guests will 
 be allowed. The in-person version of the event will be held at the West Vi
 llage Dining Commons in the Ensemble Room. RSVP here [2] to reserve your s
 pot.\n\nEvent abstract:\nShould international pro-climate actors speak up 
 against climate rogues? Or do foreign critics risk igniting nationalist ba
 cklash against global environmental norms? We explore naming and shaming d
 ynamics in global climate politics by fielding survey experiments to natio
 nally representative samples in Brazil. Our results confirm the theoretica
 l expectation that nationalism moderates how mass publics react to foreign
  climate shaming: individuals who are highly attached to their nation are 
 more likely to reject international criticism than their lowly attached pe
 ers. Yet\, in contrast to theoretical expectations\, we show that national
 ist publics prefer to reject foreign criticism rather than virulently defy
  the critical message. Our findings hold irrespective of the source of cri
 ticism (that is\, whether the critic is an allied nation or a geopolitical
  adversary)\, and the nature of the critical message (that is\, whether th
 e cue is couched in cosmopolitan language or not). These results sound a c
 autionary note on the belief that liberal internationalists should tread c
 arefully so as not to unadvisedly unleash nationalist\, neo-populist\, or 
 "antiglobalist" pushback. While pro-climate foreign critics may well bump 
 up against nationalist sentiment in climate rogues no matter who they are 
 or how they speak\, climate criticism will not necessarily fuel an all-out
  backlash against global environmental norms and institutions.\n\nLinks:\n

 \nProfessor Cheng-Chien Chen | Department of Physics\, University of Alaba
 ma at Birmingham\nAbstract: Super-hard materials exhibit a Vickers hardnes
 s H ≥ 40 GPa\, and they have extensive industrial and technological appl
 ications. Due to the huge search space of possible element combinations\, 
 it is challenging to explore new superhard ternary or quaternary materials
 . In this talk\, I will first discuss machine learning (ML) discovery of n
 ew superhard B-C-N and B-N-O compounds. The ML results are validated by ev
 olutionary structure prediction and density functional theory (DFT). In pa
 rticular\, the proposed BC10N has a low formation energy and a high hardne
 ss H ~ 86 GPa only next to diamond. In the second part of the talk\, I wil
 l discuss calculations of entropy formation ability (EFA) using both DFT a
 nd ML for 5-metal hexagonal high-entropy borides. The calculations indicat
 e that EFA serves as a good descriptor for the synthesizability of high-en
 tropy materials\, some of which have superior mechanical properties promis
 ing for applications in extreme environments.\n\nBio: Cheng-Chien Chen rec
 eived his Ph.D. in Physics from Stanford University in\, 2011. Afterwards 
 he became a Postdoctoral Scholar at the SLAC National Accelerator Laborato
 ry and later an Aneesur Rahman Postdoctoral Fellow at the Argonne National
  Laboratory. He joined the Department of Physics at the University of Alab
 ama at Birmingham (UAB) as an Assistant Professor in 2016. He is currently
  a Leadership Resource Allocation (LRAC) Awardee to use the NSF-funded Fro
 ntera Supercomputer and an NSF EPSCoR Research Fellow. Dr. Chen’s expert
 ise lies in using quantum many-body simulations\, first-principles calcula
 tions\, and machine learning approaches to model and predict the propertie
 s of various quantum and functional materials.\n\nPlease register by Septe

 stract:\n\nAnimals must execute robust\, agile movement in a variety of bi
 omechanical and environmental contexts. The nervous system must encode inf
 ormation for movement across multiple muscles in the "all-or-none" message
 s of action potentials. Sequences of action potentials\, or spikes\, can c
 arry information in the number of spikes and their timing. Spike timing co
 des are critical in many sensory systems\, but there is now growing eviden
 ce that millisecond-scale changes in timing also carry information in moto
 r brain regions\, descending decision-making circuits\, and individual mot
 or units. However\, a thorough investigation of the importance of spike ti
 ming at the millisecond-scale for encoding information\, coordinating musc
 les\, and causally changing motor behavior would require recording a compr
 ehensive\, spike-resolved motor program across a complete set of muscles t
 hat actuate a behavior.\n\nThis work leverages the comprehensive\, spike-r
 esolved motor program of the hawk moth to demonstrate that the currency of
  motor control is millisecond-scale precise spike timings. We show that ac
 ross the ten muscles that control the wings during flight\, spike timing e
 ncodes more information about yaw torque than spike rate\, and that spike 
 timing encodes all coordinated information between pairs of muscles\, desp
 ite there being sufficient bandwidth to encode the information in spike ra
 te. We introduce a method to assess the necessary spike timing precision t
 o encode information about behavior. In the comprehensive motor program of
  the hawk moth\, the information encoded in spikes is precise to the milli
 second or sub-millisecond scale\, losing information when noise is added t
 o spikes that exceeds several milliseconds. We demonstrate through classif
 ication that the motor program we record is indeed comprehensive\, capable
  of near perfect classification of six types of behavior elicited in respo
 nse to drifting visual stimuli as long as millisecond-scale information ab
 out spikes is available. Additionally\, we demonstrate consistency in how 
 muscles are coordinated across different types of behavior\, though functi
 onally different spiking activity occurs. Finally\, we investigate specifi
 c precise spike timing differences observed in the six behavior types to d
 emonstrate causality of millisecond-scale spike timing for behavior.\n\nLi

 \n\nAbstract:\nGiven a collection of observations and a class of models\, 
 the objective of a typical unsupervised learning algorithm is to find the 
 model in the class that best fits the data. However\, real datasets are ty
 pically exposed to some source of noise. Robust statistics focuses on the 
 design of outlier-robust estimators — algorithms that can tolerate a con
 stant fraction of corrupted data points or other small departures from mod
 el assumptions\, independent of the dimension. In the outlier-robust setti
 ng\, it is challenging to develop efficient learning algorithms for many w
 ell-known high-dimensional models.\n\nWe give an efficient algorithm for t
 he problem of robustly learning Gaussian mixtures. The main tools are an e
 fficient partial clustering algorithm that relies on the sum-of-squares me
 thod\, and a novel tensor decomposition algorithm that allows errors in bo
 th Frobenius norm and low-rank terms. I will also discuss the problems of 
 robustly learning affine transformations and robustly learning multi-view 
 models\, and the possible approaches to solve these problems: e.g.\, robus
 t tensor decomposition.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.edu/node/650757#0

 568440634/5222\n\nAbstract\nIce accretion can significantly degrade the pe
 rformance\, stability\, availability\, and affordability of an airborne ve
 hicle. It is imperative that this phenomenon be modeled accurately. While 
 ice accretion studies have been performed on airplane wings\, propellers\,
  and helicopter blades\, there are very few attempts to model the process 
 on more complex geometries such as fuselages. In this study\, an existing 
 in-house Extended Messinger methodology is generalized for complex geometr
 ies by modeling the flow field and water droplet transport on unstructured
  grids\, and carrying out the ice accretion calculations along surface str
 eamlines.\n\nA general framework has been developed\, allowing the use of 
 two-dimensional and three-dimensional\, structured\, and unstructured\, pu
 blic domain and commercial CFD analyses. The methodology is primarily spil
 t into three steps: the continuum flow field analysis\, the dispersed wate
 r phase computations\, and the ice accretion module. In the present study\
 , in-house methodologies as well as commercial solvers such as STAR-CCM+ a
 nd ANSYS Fluent have been used for the flow field and droplet dispersed ph
 ase computations. The in-house methodologies for the dispersed water dropl
 et transport are done using an Eulerian approach\, with a one-way interact
 ion between the air flow and the dispersed phase via the drag force exerte
 d on the droplets by the air flow. The ice accretion is carried out along 
 surface streamlines\, or optionally along two-dimensional section cuts\, u
 sing an in-house icing methodology based on the Extended-Messinger model.\
 n\nThe predictions from the present approach are compared to available exp
 erimental data\, and predictions using other solvers such as LEWICE and ST
 AR-CCM+. Several configurations with varying levels of complexity are mode
 led. These include 2-D airfoils\, swept wings\, and helicopter fuselage co
 nfigurations. Time and space sensitivity studies have been done.\n\nCommit

 als in Stein 5-5:30pm after the talk.\n\nDr. Grover’s research activitie
 s in process systems engineering focus on understanding macromolecular org
 anization and the emergence of biological function. Discrete atoms and mol
 ecules interact to form macromolecules and even larger mesoscale assemblie
 s\, ultimately yielding macroscopic structures and properties. A quantitat
 ive relationship between the nanoscale discrete interactions and the macro
 scale properties is required to design\, optimize\, and control such syste
 ms\; yet in many applications\, predictive models do not exist or are comp
 utationally intractable.\n\nThe Grover group [1] is dedicated to the devel
 opment of tractable and practical approaches for the engineering of macros
 cale behavior via explicit consideration of molecular and atomic scale int
 eractions. We focus on applications involving the kinetics of self-assembl
 y\, specifically those in which methods from non-equilibrium statistical m
 echanics do not provide closed form solutions. General approaches employed
  include stochastic modeling\, model reduction\, machine learning\, experi
 mental design\, robust parameter design\, and estimation.\n\nhttps://chbe.

 kable opportunities we have to improve the lives of others through our car
 eers\, followed by a lengthy Q&A session. There will be free samosas and s
 nacks!\n\nOne possible approach to doing good is "earning to give". Someon
 e in the US earning $65K/year—which is already more than the income of 9
 9% of people in the world—would be able to save dozens of lives over the
  course of their career by donating to effective charities such as the Aga
 inst Malaria Foundation. This is an incredible amount of impact! But anoth
 er option which is likely even more impactful is applying our skills in CS
  to directly work on pressing global problems\, and ultimately have a more
  meaningful and fulfilling career.\n\nEffective altruism is a global movem
 ent centered around how we can use evidence and reason to help us do the m
 ost good we can\, given our limited time and resources. You can learn more
  about Effective Altruism at GT on its website https://eagatech.org/ [1]\,
  subscribe to its mailing list at http://eepurl.com/hHt6vr [2]\, and join 
 its GroupMe at https://groupme.com/join_group/68220460/aC3JTAuO [3].\n\nGT
  CS Careers Club is dedicated to forming a space where GT students interes
 ted in careers in computer science can discuss their careers\, prepare for
  interviews\, find open jobs\, have their resumes critiqued\, and receive

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Public\
 , Undergraduate students\nStatus: draft\n\nAbstract:\n\nWith the rise and 
 proliferation of gig economy platforms providing ride hailing\, food deliv
 ery and other app-based services on-demand in major urban centers of the w
 orld\, there have been major transformations in work and life globally. Gi
 g platforms have certainly disrupted and redefined the discovery and alloc
 ation of casual work through algorithmic management\, creating grave conce
 rns for regulating the future of work. Simultaneously\, especially in the 
 global South\, gig platforms have also emerged as important avenues for ga
 ining temporary paid work and socio-economic mobility for low income indiv
 iduals\, women and migrant workers. Drawing on over five years of ethnogra
 phic research with a variety of stakeholders in the gig economy including 
 workers\, managers\, consumers and regulators\, my work shows how platform
 ization produces heterogeneous effects on the lives\, livelihoods and prod
 uctive and reproductive capacities of different individuals in urban India
 . This talk will draw on multiple case studies of gig work to show these h
 eterogeneous effects and how everyday technology practice also informs pla
