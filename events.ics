SUMMARY:Assistant Professor Levi Wood: Systems Analysis of Neural Immune S
 ignaling in Neurodegenerative Diseases
DTSTART;TZID=UTC;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20200730T200000Z

DESCRIPTION:Status: unknown\n\nDysregulated neural immune activity contrib
 utes to the pathogenesis of diverse diseases\, including Alzheimer’s dis
 ease\, traumatic brain injury\, and lysosomal storage disorders\, among ot
 hers. Understanding neural immune function and identification of strategie
 s to restore healthy or homeostatic immune activity holds the potential to
  transform our ability to treat neurodegenerative diseases. Neural immune 
 activity is a complex system\, consisting of intracellular regulation of d
 iverse immune genes by phospho-signaling cascades that ultimately control 
 glial phenotypes and expression of extra-cellular signaling factors\, such
  as cytokines\, that communicate between cells and exacerbate dysfunction.
  This talk will consist of two parts.\n\nIn the first part\, I will discus
 s our work\, in collaboration with Dr. Amit Reddi\, to illuminate the role
  of the blood factors heme and hemoglobin in potentiating Alzheimer’s di
 sease pathogenesis. We have found that elevation of these factors in Alzhe
 imer’s disease suppresses immune function of the brain’s immune cells\
 , astrocytes and microglia\, including their abilities to clear amyloid be
 ta\, which is the hallmark protein that forms plaques in Alzheimer’s bra
 ins. By integrating extracellular (cytokine) and intracellular (phospho-pr
 otein) signaling data\, we have determined that heme and hemoglobin attenu
 ate normal immune function by stimulating the PI3K/Akt pathway. Moreover\,
  attenuation of the heme biosynthetic pathway reduced amyloid beta patholo
 gy in 5xFAD Alzheimer’s disease mice. Together\, these data illuminate a
 n entirely new aspect of Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis and suggest a 
 novel mechanism resulting in brain immune cell “fatigue\,” which may b
 e treated by attenuating heme synthesis.\n\nIn the second part\, I will di
 scuss our work to identify neuroinflammatory signaling responsible for cog
 nitive deficit after repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). We use
  a weight drop closed head injury mouse model relevant to sports injury in
  which a subset of mice experience cognitive deficit despite having no ove
 rt signs of neuronal injury. Using a non-invasive optical cerebral blood f
 low sensor\, we found that mice with acutely low cerebral blood flow after
  mTBI would suffer long term memory deficit and had elevated acute microgl
 ial activation. Surprisingly\, microglial activation was accompanied by ne
 uronal pro-inflammatory phospho-signaling and cytokine expression\, sugges
 ting for the first time that neural immunity and cognitive deficit depends
  on the interplay between glia and neurons. Moreover\, our ongoing studies
  suggest that inhibition of phospho-signaling using translationally releva
 nt small molecules has the potential to restore cognitive function after r
 epetitive mTBI.\n\nDr. Wood has been an assistant professor in the Institu
 te for Bioengineering and Bioscience at Georgia Tech since August 2015. He
  completed his PhD at MIT where he developed novel microfluidics to identi
 fy mechanisms governing blood vessel geometry during angiogenesis. For his
  postdoc\, Levi\, joined the signaling systems biology laboratories of Kev
 in Haigis and Douglas Lauffenburger at MGH and MIT. While there\, he used 
 engineering systems methods to identify new mechanisms of cell death in Al
 zheimer’s disease and the inflamed intestine. The Wood lab combines engi
 neering systems analysis with multi-dimensional datasets from human tissue
 s\, mouse models\, and 2D and 3D cell culture models to understand the rol
 es of neural immune activity in promoting healthy brain function and in dr
 iving diverse neurological disorders. In addition to identifying underlyin
 g mechanisms of disease\, Dr. Wood has a particular interest in identifyin
 g rapidly translatable treatment approaches using re-purposed drugs for ca
 ncer and other conditions that may already be commercially available or la
 te stage development. Dr. Wood’s areas of study include traumatic brain 
 injury\, Alzheimer’s disease\, and the lysosomal storage disorder\, muco
 lipidosis IV.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  https://www.chemistry.gatech.edu/event/assis

 [02]."\n\nThe self-help technique to be shared may provide you with some w
 ays to calm down stress and other emotions. However\, it is not a treatmen

  you create the biology of courage. And when you choose to connect with ot
 hers under stress\, you can create resilience....Stress gives us access to
  our hearts. The compassionate heart that finds joy and meaning in connect
 ing with others\, and yes\, your pounding physical heart\, working so hard
  to give you strength and energy. And when you choose to view stress in th
 is way\, you're not just getting better at stress\, you're actually making
  a pretty profound statement. You're saying that you can trust yourself to
  handle life's challenges. And you're remembering that you don't have to f
 ace them alone. "\n- Video: " First Aid for Emotional Distress - Trauma Ta

 \, Undergraduate students\nStatus: draft\n\nThe build up of stress has con
 sequences for the mind and body. Poor sleep\, lack of appetite\, decreased
  productivity\, decreased immunity\, susceptibility to sickness\, are some
  of the few\, and we might find it difficult to get out of the vicious cyc
 le of stress. Except\, nowadays there are some very simple and effective w
 ays to nip the stress bud so we can prevent the over-growth! Come\, join\,
  and learn and try "Tapping" - a simple stress management method to add to
  your tool box. A brief introduction (and actually doing it) is all you ne
 ed so we can better Tap into calm. When: Noon ~ 12:30\, most Fridays start
 ing August 28.\nWhere: Drop In Zoom (Initial download/setup likely require
 d for phone/computer) [01]\nWhat: 1. "Tapping" similar to this video " Tra

 are not inevitable. How you think and how you act can transform your exper
 ience of stress. When you choose to view your stress response as helpful\,
  you create the biology of courage. And when you choose to connect with ot
 hers under stress\, you can create resilience....Stress gives us access to
  our hearts. The compassionate heart that finds joy and meaning in connect
 ing with others\, and yes\, your pounding physical heart\, working so hard
  to give you strength and energy. And when you choose to view stress in th
 is way\, you're not just getting better at stress\, you're actually making
  a pretty profound statement. You're saying that you can trust yourself to
  handle life's challenges. And you're remembering that you don't have to f
 ace them alone. "\n- Video: " First Aid for Emotional Distress - Trauma Ta

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Postdoc
 \, Undergraduate students\nStatus: draft\n\nThe build up of stress has con
 sequences for the mind and body. Poor sleep\, lack of appetite\, decreased
  productivity\, decreased immunity\, susceptibility to sickness\, are some
  of the few\, and we might find it difficult to get out of the vicious cyc
 le of stress. Except\, nowadays there are some very simple and effective w
 ays to nip the stress bud so we can prevent the over-growth! Come\, join\,
  and learn and try "Tapping" - a simple stress management method to add to
  your tool box. A brief introduction (and actually doing it) is all you ne
 ed so we can better Tap into calm. When: Noon ~ 12:30\, most Fridays start
 ing August 28.\nWhere: Drop In Zoom (Initial download/setup likely require
 d for phone/computer) [01]\nWhat: 1. "Tapping" similar to this video " Tra
 uma Tapping Technique [02]."\n2. Chat and Q&A (Please feel free to leave e
 arly after Tapping\, as needed\, or you are more than welcome to stay a li
 ttle longer and enjoy a Q&A and some more chat.)\n\n- Mental Health Resour

 are not inevitable. How you think and how you act can transform your exper
 ience of stress. When you choose to view your stress response as helpful\,
  you create the biology of courage. And when you choose to connect with ot
 hers under stress\, you can create resilience....Stress gives us access to
  our hearts. The compassionate heart that finds joy and meaning in connect
 ing with others\, and yes\, your pounding physical heart\, working so hard
  to give you strength and energy. And when you choose to view stress in th
 is way\, you're not just getting better at stress\, you're actually making
  a pretty profound statement. You're saying that you can trust yourself to
  handle life's challenges. And you're remembering that you don't have to f
 ace them alone. "\n- Video: " First Aid for Emotional Distress - Trauma Ta

 nJoin the BlueJeans Meeting [1]\n\nABSTRACT\nAntarctic krill (Euphausia su
 perba) is a key component of the Antarctic food web with considerable lipi
 d reserves that are vital for both their own and higher predator survival.
  Krill feed on diatoms\, dinoflagellates and other algal species year-roun
 d\, resulting in high omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids which are essent
 ial for krill health\, growth and reproduction. Krill-derived omega-3 cont
 aining products (particularly eicosapentacnoic acid (20:5w3) and docosahex
 aenoic acid (22:6w3)) are sold as nutraceuticals for human consumption. Kr
 ill oil tablets (sold as an omega-3 supplement) are now one of the fastest
  growing nutraceuticals globally. However\, few attempts have been made to
  link the spatial and temporal variations in krill lipids to those in thei
 r food supply. Knowledge of krill diet and krill lipid dynamics is lacking
  for the Indian and Pacific Oceans\, as most studies have focused on the S
 outh Atlantic Ocean sector where the krill fishery is based. Most research
  voyages are conducted during the summer and all scientific studies are re
 stricted in their spatial and temporal scales. Another major gap in curren
 t Antarctic ecosystem models is the link between environmental drivers and
  their impact on primary production and therefore food availability. Satel
 lite-derived data for biological and ecological measures is still developi
 ng as a tool although outputs such as ocean colour data which can be conve
 rted into chlorophyll a concentrations (a proxy for primary production)\, 
 are becoming more common. This seminar will cover recent developments in t
 he knowledge of spatiotemporal fluctuations of krill lipid biochemistry in
  relation to their environment.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.edu/node/

 \, Undergraduate students\nStatus: draft\n\nThe build up of stress has con
 sequences for the mind and body. Poor sleep\, lack of appetite\, decreased
  productivity\, decreased immunity\, susceptibility to sickness\, are some
  of the few\, and we might find it difficult to get out of the vicious cyc
 le of stress. Except\, nowadays there are some very simple and effective w
 ays to nip the stress bud so we can prevent the over-growth! Come\, join\,
  and learn and try "Tapping" - a simple stress management method to add to
  your tool box. A brief introduction (and actually doing it) is all you ne
 ed so we can better Tap into calm. When: Noon ~ 12:30\, most Fridays start
 ing August 28.\nWhere: Drop In Zoom (Initial download/setup likely require

  you create the biology of courage. And when you choose to connect with ot
 hers under stress\, you can create resilience....Stress gives us access to
  our hearts. The compassionate heart that finds joy and meaning in connect
 ing with others\, and yes\, your pounding physical heart\, working so hard
  to give you strength and energy. And when you choose to view stress in th
 is way\, you're not just getting better at stress\, you're actually making
  a pretty profound statement. You're saying that you can trust yourself to
  handle life's challenges. And you're remembering that you don't have to f

  [1]\n\nAbstract\nVarious tightly integrated aircraft concepts have emerge
 d as a result of aggressive performance goals set forth by various organiz
 ations. Most integrated aircraft system configurations exploit the concept
  of Boundary Layer Ingestion (BLI). While the potential benefits of BLI ar
 e huge\, several significant challenges - both on the modeling and design 
 fronts - appear due to BLI. This dissertation focuses on addressing the im
 pacts of BLI induced circumferential flow distortion on the conceptual des
 ign of a fan stage.\n\nDistortion introduces extra losses in both rotors a
 nd stators in addition to increased unsteady rotor response. In presence o
 f incidence swings\, conventional conceptual design tools are inadequate t
 o design optimal rotor blades and generate non-axisymmetric stators\, a co
 ncept that has shown promise in alleviating stage losses due to distortion
 . Besides\, concerns of structural integrity also arise for rotor blades d
 ue to the unsteady loading they experience when rotating in a distorted fl
 ow field. Parametric effects of these phenomena with varying levels of dis
 tortion are quantified\, and a significant portion of the fan stage losses
  are shown to be recoverable using the aero-structural design framework in
 troduced and developed in this dissertation.\n\nThe aerodynamic design fra
 mework is developed through several extensions to the conventionally used 
 multi-meanline method. The inclusion of additional features accounts for f
 low asymmetry\, parametric blade angle optimization\, rotor unsteady perfo
 rmance\, and non-axisymmetric stator design. The model is verified\, and e
 xperiments are performed to evaluate the effectiveness of each modeling el
 ement. Similarly\, the Variational Asymptotic Method (VAM) is proposed as 
 a computationally efficient technique to perform transient structural anal
 ysis of rotor blades. VAM is validated for a variety of loading scenarios 
 and is leveraged to demonstrate the nature of vibratory stresses and highl
 ight the concerns of resonance on a test case. The framework encapsulating
  both aerodynamic design and structural analysis is finally utilized to ex
 plore the design space to minimize vibratory stresses on the blades with a
  small trade-off in the stage efficiency. The fan stage design resulting f
 rom the framework proposed and formulated in this dissertation aims to ser
 ve as a starting point for the preliminary design of a distortion-tolerant
  fan.\n\nCommittee\n\n- Prof. Dimitri Mavris – School of Aerospace Engin

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Postdoc
 \, Undergraduate students\nStatus: draft\n\nThe build up of stress has con
 sequences for the mind and body. Poor sleep\, lack of appetite\, decreased
  productivity\, decreased immunity\, susceptibility to sickness\, are some
  of the few\, and we might find it difficult to get out of the vicious cyc
 le of stress. Except\, nowadays there are some very simple and effective w
 ays to nip the stress bud so we can prevent the over-growth! Come\, join\,
  and learn and try "Tapping" - a simple stress management method to add to
  your tool box. A brief introduction (and actually doing it) is all you ne
 ed so we can better Tap into calm. When: Noon ~ 12:30\, most Fridays start
 ing August 28.\nWhere: Drop In Zoom (Initial download/setup likely require
 d for phone/computer) [01]\nWhat: 1. "Tapping" similar to this video " Tra
 uma Tapping Technique [02]."\n2. Chat and Q&A (Please feel free to leave e
 arly after Tapping\, as needed\, or you are more than welcome to stay a li
 ttle longer and enjoy a Q&A and some more chat.)\n\n- Mental Health Resour

 are not inevitable. How you think and how you act can transform your exper
 ience of stress. When you choose to view your stress response as helpful\,
  you create the biology of courage. And when you choose to connect with ot
 hers under stress\, you can create resilience....Stress gives us access to
  our hearts. The compassionate heart that finds joy and meaning in connect
 ing with others\, and yes\, your pounding physical heart\, working so hard
  to give you strength and energy. And when you choose to view stress in th
 is way\, you're not just getting better at stress\, you're actually making
  a pretty profound statement. You're saying that you can trust yourself to
  handle life's challenges. And you're remembering that you don't have to f
 ace them alone. "\n- Video: " First Aid for Emotional Distress - Trauma Ta

 \, Undergraduate students\nStatus: draft\n\nThe build up of stress has con
 sequences for the mind and body. Poor sleep\, lack of appetite\, decreased
  productivity\, decreased immunity\, susceptibility to sickness\, are some
  of the few\, and we might find it difficult to get out of the vicious cyc
 le of stress. Except\, nowadays there are some very simple and effective w
 ays to nip the stress bud so we can prevent the over-growth! Come\, join\,
  and learn and try "Tapping" - a simple stress management method to add to
  your tool box. A brief introduction (and actually doing it) is all you ne
 ed so we can better Tap into calm. When: Noon ~ 12:30\, most Fridays start
 ing August 28.\nWhere: Drop In Zoom (Initial download/setup likely require
 d for phone/computer) [01]\nWhat: 1. "Tapping" similar to this video " Tra
 uma Tapping Technique [02]."\n2. Chat and Q&A (Please feel free to leave e

 are not inevitable. How you think and how you act can transform your exper
 ience of stress. When you choose to view your stress response as helpful\,
  you create the biology of courage. And when you choose to connect with ot
 hers under stress\, you can create resilience....Stress gives us access to
  our hearts. The compassionate heart that finds joy and meaning in connect
 ing with others\, and yes\, your pounding physical heart\, working so hard
  to give you strength and energy. And when you choose to view stress in th
 is way\, you're not just getting better at stress\, you're actually making
  a pretty profound statement. You're saying that you can trust yourself to
  handle life's challenges. And you're remembering that you don't have to f
 ace them alone. "\n- Video: " First Aid for Emotional Distress - Trauma Ta

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Postdoc
 \, Undergraduate students\nStatus: draft\n\nThe build up of stress has con
 sequences for the mind and body. Poor sleep\, lack of appetite\, decreased
  productivity\, decreased immunity\, susceptibility to sickness\, are some
  of the few\, and we might find it difficult to get out of the vicious cyc
 le of stress. Except\, nowadays there are some very simple and effective w
 ays to nip the stress bud so we can prevent the over-growth! Come\, join\,
  and learn and try "Tapping" - a simple stress management method to add to
  your tool box. A brief introduction (and actually doing it) is all you ne
 ed so we can better Tap into calm. When: Noon ~ 12:30\, most Fridays start
 ing August 28.\nWhere: Drop In Zoom (Initial download/setup likely require
 d for phone/computer) [01]\nWhat: 1. "Tapping" similar to this video " Tra
 uma Tapping Technique [02]."\n2. Chat and Q&A (Please feel free to leave e
 arly after Tapping\, as needed\, or you are more than welcome to stay a li
 ttle longer and enjoy a Q&A and some more chat.)\n\n- Mental Health Resour

 are not inevitable. How you think and how you act can transform your exper
 ience of stress. When you choose to view your stress response as helpful\,
  you create the biology of courage. And when you choose to connect with ot
 hers under stress\, you can create resilience....Stress gives us access to
  our hearts. The compassionate heart that finds joy and meaning in connect
 ing with others\, and yes\, your pounding physical heart\, working so hard
  to give you strength and energy. And when you choose to view stress in th
 is way\, you're not just getting better at stress\, you're actually making
  a pretty profound statement. You're saying that you can trust yourself to
  handle life's challenges. And you're remembering that you don't have to f
 ace them alone. "\n- Video: " First Aid for Emotional Distress - Trauma Ta

 \, Public\, Undergraduate students\nStatus: published\n\nGordana Vunjak-No
 vakovic\, Ph.D.\nUniversity Professor\nThe Mikati Foundation Professor of 
 Biomedical Engineering and Medicine\nDirector\, Laboratory for Stem Cells 
 and Tissue Engineering\nColumbia University\n\nApproximately 35 million me
 n and women in the United States suffer from TMJ problems\, and as many as
  one in four people experience symptoms of TMJ disorders\, including pain 
 in the chewing muscles\, jaw stiffness\, clicking\, popping or grating\, o
 r the pain of arthritis. The temporomandibular joint\, or TMJ\, is the jaw
  joint that lies in front of each ear\, connecting the mandible (lower jaw
 ) to the skull\, providing the mobility necessary for biting\, chewing\, s
 wallowing food\, speaking\, and making facial expressions.\n\nGordana Vunj
 ak-Novakovic and her research team have been able to grow bone grafts that
  will match a patient’s original jaw bone for facial reconstruction surg
 ery to repair injuries\, disease\, or birth defects. This spectacular adva
 ncement in bone tissue engineering provides all the advantages of the body
 ’s original jaw bone. The team used real bone as a scaffold to grow the 
 new TMJ graft. Taking the knee joints of calves\, they stripped them of al
 l their living cells and carved them into cubic centimeter-size parts of a
  human jaw joint.\n\nUsing mesenchymal stem cells\, which can differentiat
 e into many cell types\, to seed the scaffolding\, they fed them with stre
 ams of nutrients\, growth factors\, and oxygen in a bioreactor. The next s
 tep will be to determine the best way to grow blood vessels in the bone gr
 afts to continue their viability.\n\nIn another research area\, Vunjak-Nov
 akovic is engineering thick\, vascularized\, and electromechanically funct
 ional cardiac tissue\, by culturing stem cells\, the actual “tissue engi
 neers\,” on a channeled elastomer scaffold perfused with culture medium 
 containing oxygen carriers\, to mimic blood flow. This research may lead t
 o a heart patch that could be laid over injured heart tissue to restore no
 rmal function in someone who has suffered a heart attack.\n\n“As a biome
 dical engineer actively involved in this field\, I look forward to unlocki
 ng the full regenerative potential of human stem cells\, so we can cure di
 sease and live longer than our failing organs\,” she said.\n\nHer lab ho
 sts the Bioreactor Core of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Tissue 
 Engineering Resource Center. “This sophisticated bioreactor and imaging 
 instrumentation has moved stem cell research from the ‘flat biology’ o
 f petri dishes to controllable models of high biological fidelity\, which 
 can be studied in real time to observe the interacting factors mediating s
 elf-renewal and differentiation of stem cells\,” said Vunjak-Novakovic. 
 “We now have the capacity to develop entirely new research paradigms and
  approaches to engineering human tissues.”\n\nIn 2002\, Vunjak-Novakovic
  was elected a fellow of the American Institute for Medical and Biological
  Engineering. In 2007\, she gave the Director’s lecture at the NIH\, as 
 the first woman engineer to receive this distinction. She was inducted int
 o the Women in Technology International Hall of Fame in 2008\, elected to 
 the New York Academy of Sciences in 2009\, and\, in 2010\, received the Cl
 emson Award of the Biomaterials Society for contribution to literature.\n\

  our hearts. The compassionate heart that finds joy and meaning in connect
 ing with others\, and yes\, your pounding physical heart\, working so hard
  to give you strength and energy. And when you choose to view stress in th
 is way\, you're not just getting better at stress\, you're actually making
  a pretty profound statement. You're saying that you can trust yourself to
  handle life's challenges. And you're remembering that you don't have to f
 ace them alone. "\n- Video: " First Aid for Emotional Distress - Trauma Ta

  Prof. Mavris)\n\nwill defend a doctoral thesis entitled\,\n\nStructural A
 nalysis and Optimization of Aircraft Wings Through Dimensional Reduction\n
 \nOn\n\nTuesday\, December 15\, 2020 at 9:00 a.m.\n[1]\n\nAbstract\nFedera
 l Aviation Regulations (FARs) are critical drivers of aircraft design. Ear
 ly-stage aircraft design involves a tight coupling between structural dyna
 mics\, aerodynamics\, and flight mechanics\, with time-dependent loads ari
 sing from the considerations of the FARs. The current state-of-the-art dec
 ouples the time-domain simulation from the structural failure computation 
 due to high computational costs associated with time-domain structural fai
 lure computation. The need to account for the dynamic loads specified by t
 he FARs while simultaneously achieving low structural weight for fuel effi
 ciency in early-stage aircraft design motivates the following question: Ho
 w to enable computationally efficient structural analysis and optimization
  of early-stage aircraft wing design\, considering dynamics?\n\nExisting m
 ethods simplify the dynamic loads to equivalent static ones and design the
  structure using shell-based analysis. Other literature approaches use com
 putationally efficient beam models for structural sizing but make assumpti
 ons on the geometry and/or material distribution. Higher-order beam theori
 es for structural analysis have been successfully applied to the design of
  slender structures subjected to time-dependent loads\, like rotorcraft bl
 ades. While aircraft wings can be considered slender structures\, aperiodi
 city\, and inhomogeneity along the span render beam theory ineffective.\n\
 nThe present work aims to bridge this gap by proposing a method for analyz
 ing 3-D structures through dimensional reduction. The use of the Variation
 al Asymptotic Method (VAM) is explored for the systematic reduction of 3-D
  structures to 1-D models and further\, recover 3-D stresses and strains a
 fter solving the 1-D problem.\n\nA stiffness matching approach is proposed
  to dimensionally reduce 3-D features such as stiffeners by locally smeari
 ng them on the base plate. The proposed method allows for stiffeners of va
 rying dimensions\, topology\, and spacing to be smeared. The stiffness mat
 ching further allows the beam cross-sectional properties computed from VAM
  to be equal to a box-beam cross-section. The equivalence enables the use 
 of Euler-Bernoulli type analytical stiffness computation while retaining t
 he accuracy of VAM. Analytical expressions allow for rapid evaluation of t
 he beam properties and stress recovery and further permit the use of Autom
 atic Differentiation (AD) to obtain partial derivatives. The proposed stru
 ctural analysis method is applied to the wing structural analysis of a nov
 el distributed electric propulsion aircraft- NASA's PEGASUS concept\, and 
 the open-source CRM.\n\nA general adjoint method for dynamic simulations i
 s presented and applied to a nonlinear Timoshenko beam theory. It combines
  general beam residual equations with an adjoint method to extract gradien
 t information from the load time-history. Aggregated constraints implement
 ed for sizing are stress-based\, combining axial stresses at the beam corn
 ers with shear stresses from torsion and external loads at both corners an
 d mid-sections. CasASDi\, an open-source tool for nonlinear optimization a
 nd algorithmic differentiation\, is used to generate expressions and calcu
 late derivatives for the relevant equations used for analysis and optimiza
 tion. Numerical tests are conducted to test the accuracy of the adjoint co
 mputations and scalability as the number of design variables increase. A s
 tructural optimization framework is developed for the beam-based dynamic a
 nalysis method presented\, allowing for the structure's sizing under stren
 gth-based failure considerations. The PEGASUS concept is used as a testbed
  to demonstrate the sizing capabilities. The structure is sized for FARs s
 pecified maneuver loads– static 2.5g and -1.0g\, and dynamic gusts.\n\nF
 indings show that: 1) the use of VAM allows for the systematic extraction 
 of beam properties for aircraft wings\, 2) the displacement and stress res
 ponse of the aircraft using beam models match reasonably well against thos
 e produced by shell-based models\, 3) for dynamic simulations\, the derive
 d adjoint method computes accurate gradients efficiently to be used in str
 uctural optimization\, 4) sizing of aircraft wings for FARs specified mane
 uvers using the proposed approach produces a 6% error compared to the shel
 l-based method\, but with a 7.8x speed-up.\n\nThe proposed approach provid
 es improvements on the existing literature methods- it is computationally 
 efficient\, provides reasonable accuracy for early-stage structural sizing
  and weight prediction\, and includes dynamic effects. The computational e
 fficiency makes it well-suited for many-query applications like optimizati
 on\, uncertainty quantification\, and generating data for surrogate modeli
 ng.\n\nCommittee\n\n- Prof. Dimitri N. Mavris – School of Aerospace Engi

 tructured Environments"\n\nAbstract: Robotic systems have traditional been
  very successful in performing tasks where the inputs are well defined and
  known in advance. Automotive and electronic manufacturing are the classic
  success stories where robotic systems have demonstrated incredible value 
 for the industry. The tasks performed by the robots almost exclusively inv
 olve the manipulation or interacting with objects whose physical propertie
 s are known a priori and the objects are rigid and dry. In the many manufa
 cturing sectors\, robotic systems must be able to work in an unstructured 
 environment where every product is unique\, deformable and even wet. This 
 presentation will discuss various approaches to enable autonomous solution
 s to these problems. This will include software to minimize manual program
 ming of robots as well systems that integrate advanced perception and cont
 rol technologies to perform complex tasks like cutting\, grasping\, and ma
 nipulation.\n\nBio: Gary McMurray is a Principal Research Engineer and Div
 ision Chief for the Intelligent Sustainable Technologies Division at the G
 eorgia Tech Research Institute. He is also an Associate Director for the I
 nstitute for Robotics and Intelligent Machines (IRIM) at Georgia Tech. IRI
 M serves as an umbrella under which robotics researchers\, educators\, and
  students from across campus can come together to advance the many high-po
 wered and diverse robotics activities at Georgia Tech. The Intelligent Sus
 tainable Technologies Division conducts innovative research to improve the
  human condition through transforming the agricultural and food systems\, 
 sustainable use and access to energy and water\, and safety of people at w
 ork and from pandemics. Mr. McMurray’s research has focused on the devel
 opment of robotic technologies and solutions for the manufacturing and agr
 ibusiness communities\, including the protein and the fruit and vegetable 
 industries. He is an expert in visual servoing – the use of vision for t
 he real-time control of robotics\, and the author of over 50-refereed tech
 nical papers and journal publications in robotics.\n\nMr. McMurray serves 
 on the advisory board for Advanced Animal Systems for the Foundation of Fo
 od and Agricultural Research. He also serves on the Board of Directors for
  the Robotics Industry Association.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.edu/n

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Postdoc
 \, Public\, Undergraduate students\nStatus: published\n\nScheller Lunchtim
 e Live is a livestream series hosted by the Georgia Tech Scheller College 
 of Business featuring faculty\, student\, and alumni speakers discussing r
 elevant topics for the tech-driven\, digital age.\n\nFew took notice when 
 a fledgling electric-vehicle startup with a brash Elon Musk as CEO went pu
 blic in the summer of 2010 at a valuation of $2.24 billion. Fast forward t
 o early 2021\, and Tesla is valued at some $800 trillion\, which marks an 
 appreciation of roughly 36\,000%. Although Tesla made only 500\,000 vehicl
 es in 2020\, it is more valuable than the legacy carmakers such as Toyota\
 , Volkswagen\, GM\, and Ford combined\, producing over 25 million cars in 
 the same year. What is more\, most major car companies are now fully commi
 tted to an all-electric future. How did Tesla accomplish such a dramatic i
 ndustry transformation? How will it play out? How long will it take? What 
 sectors will be affected by the mobility transformation? Who are the winne
 rs\, and who are the losers? And\, perhaps most important\, what does this
  mean for you personally and professionally?\n\nJust hit "Attend event" on
  the LinkedIn event and visit the Georgia Tech Scheller College of Busines
 s page on Friday\, March 5 at 12:00 p.m. ET to access the session.\n\nAbou
 t Frank T. Rothaermel\n\nFrank T. Rothaermel is a Professor of Strategy & 
 Innovation\, holds the Russell and Nancy McDonough Chair in the Scheller C
 ollege of Business at Georgia Tech\, and is an Alfred P. Sloan Industry St
 udies Fellow. Bloomberg Businessweek named Frank one of Georgia Tech’s P
 rominent Faculty\, while Poets & Quants selected Frank as one of the “Fa
 vorite Business School Professors Teaching MBAs.” The Kauffman Foundatio
 n views Frank as one of the world’s 75 thought leaders in entrepreneursh
 ip and innovation. Based on having published papers in the top 1% based on
  citations\, Thomson Reuters identified Frank as one of the “world’s m
 ost influential scientific minds.”\n\nFrank is also the author of a lead

 ned multiple sensors in suitable form factors for the measurement of pH an
 d dissolved oxygen in a range of culture systems such as multi-well cultur
 e plates\, microfluidics devices\, shake flasks\, and bioreactors.\n\nScie
 ntific Bioprocessing Inc. Presenters:\n\n- Jake Boy - Senior Application S
 cientist\n- Ian Sarad - Senior Bioprocessing Application Scientist\n\nPers
 onalized medicine in cell and gene therapy has moved therapeutics developm
 ent back to small scale bioreactors and added new process constraints: cos
 t and form factor. SBI has developed technologies that overcome these chal
 lenges and allow researchers to collect real-time sensing data with non-in
 vasive\, biocompatible\, sterilizable sensors.\n\nWe will also present our
  new fiber optic sensor platform that allows for sensing measurements insi
 de a bioreactor at multiple locatins in a perfusion flow loop upstream or 
 downstream of the bioreactor. This mapping can reveal stagnation zones\, i
 nsufficient mixing and other process improvement opportunities.\n\nWhile o
 vercoming form factor limitations is highly beneficial for personalized me
 dicine applications\, multi-sensing platforms are also critical in bioproc
 essing and in increasing reproducibility\, reducing cost\, and resulting i
 n better cell outcomes. We welcome the CMaT community to this presentation
  and offer evaluations of our technology to the CMaT researchers to encour
 age collaborations and help accelerate the development and commercializati
 on of cell therapies.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.edu/node/645412#0\n

 nd a walk that unites a campus and community – a time to acknowledge the
  ways in which suicide and mental illness have affected our lives and our 
 loved ones.\n\nAssociated with the American Foundation for Suicide Prevent
 ion\, we have coordinated an Out of the Darkness Campus Walk\, a national 
 event hosted by universities all over the nation to bring together a commu
 nity in support of suicide awareness through fundraising\, outreach\, and 
 togetherness.\n\nOnline registration closes at noon the Friday before the 
 walk. However\, anyone who would like to participate can register in perso

 e transdisciplinary approaches to Fresh Supply Chain and Logistics Problem
 s via Operations Research\, GIS and Strategic Management. These fresh supp
 ly chain frameworks help build market deployment roadmaps\, hub location i
 n local supply chains and sustainable logistics strategies. Our study help
 s to provide solution approaches that are directly implementable in Indust
 ry.\n\nChapter 1:\n\nIn Chapter 1\, we address the increasing corporate pr
 essure to be environmentally sustainable. Fresh supply chains face special
  considerations with decay and loss of quality in perishable products that
  can occur in transit. We provide a logistics framework that both supplier
 s and purchasers can utilize to improve the sustainability of their supply
  chain. We employ customer segmentation\, decay & quality modeling\, and l
 ife cycle analysis (LCA) to help companies rethink their logistics strateg
 ies to better align with environmentally sustainable practice. In this cha
 pter\, we apply our framework to case studies concerning fresh cut flowers
  and quick service restaurants.\n\nChapter 2:\n\nIn Chapter 2\, we propose
  a market deployment framework which outlines a company’s dynamic expans
 ion plan. We build a complementary solution approach that is made up of Ex
 ecutive Factors\, Market Ranking\, Optimization and Heuristic Models with 
 Dynamic Capabilities. This framework results in a series of alternative so
 lution roadmaps that identify which markets should be deployed in each tim
 e phase over a given time horizon. We apply our framework to a case study 
 of a platform which enables local food supply chains by connecting farmers
  directly to restaurants.\n\nChapter 3:\n\nIn Chapter 3\, we provide a Hyb
 rid OR & GIS methodological framework to the Dynamic (Mobile) Hub Location
  Problem in the context of a small-scale local food supply chain network. 
 In our hybrid approach\, we formulate our network as a p-hub median proble
 m alongside the use of Kernel Density Analysis for hub placement in the ne
 twork in the case of p = 1. We evaluate our hub effectiveness through a co
 mparison between historical distribution flows (without a mobile hub)\, ex
 pected stagnant hub routes and expected mobile hub routes (both via TSP He
 uristics utilizing real road distance).\n\nSincerely\,\n\nIsabella Sanders

 1 2:00 pm EDT\n\nLocation: [1]\n\nA physical model of a Burgers vortex was
  created in the laboratory with characteristics corresponding to dissipati
 ve-scale eddies that copepods are likely to encounter in turbulent flows. 
 Tomographic particle image velocimetry (PIV) experiments quantified the ve
 locity field of vortices to target the small-scale structure of turbulent 
 flows corresponding to dissipation rates of 0.002 to 0.25 cm2/s3. The swim
 ming behavior of three marine copepod species is assessed as a function of
  vortex strength (and size) in and around the flow structure with the vort
 ex axis aligned vertically and horizontally in the water. The studied spec
 ies are Acartia tonsa\, an estuarine copepod with a hop-sink swimming styl
 e\; Temora longicornis\, a coastal copepod with a cruise swimming style\; 
 and Calanus finmarchicus\, an open ocean copepod with a cruise-sink swimmi
 ng style. The results show that copepods change their swimming behavior wi
 th the intensity of the Burgers vortex and reveal species-specific respons
 es in nearly all kinematic parameters. A. tonsa and C. finmarchicus exhibi
 ted the strongest behavioral response to increasing vortex strength and T.
  longicornis exhibited the weakest response. A. tonsa and T. longicornis s
 howed no response to changes in vortex orientation\, whereas C. finmarchic
 us revealed some orientation dependence. One common behavior among the spe
 cies is that the swimming trajectory shape becomes increasingly curved and
  spiral around the vortex core with increasing vortex strength\, which pro
 vides a means of local aggregation and increased encounter rate with food 
 and mates. The results are interpreted in relation to differences in swimm
 ing style and setal morphology among the species. The results provide insi
 ght to the habitats in which the copepods live as well as their vertical d
 istribution in the water column relative to turbulence intensity. This com
 parative study between species highlights that variations in turbulence in
 tensity in the ocean can influence the dynamics of copepods and the ecolog
 y of marine species.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.edu/node/646166#0\n[

 t McKinley Dirksen United States Courthouse in Chicago built in 1964 is ar
 guably one of the most significant buildings in the history of judicial ar
 chitecture in the U.S. and abroad because of its transformative role in th
 e formulation of the conventions underlying contemporary courthouse design
 . Archived at the Museum of Modern Art New York (MoMA)\, a significant res
 ource associated with the design of the courthouse is the extensive docume
 ntation of the design process at the office of Mies. This body of work con
 sists of 135 sketches\, diagrams and drawings\, features alternative solut
 ions\, variational schemes\, and sectional innovations\, and provides an u
 ntapped resource to allow a closer look in the expressive range of the arc
 hitectural language and the technical innovations proposed by one of the g
 reatest architects of the twentieth century.\n\nThe work here takes on the
  Mies Archive and presents a formal reconstruction and automated completio
 n of the preliminary representations materializing the unrealized possibil
 ities embodied in the works. More specifically\, a generative description 
 of Mies’ courthouse design language is presented in the form of a shape 
 grammar implemented in the Shape Machine\, a pioneering recursive shape-re
 write technology developed at the Shape Computation Lab at the Georgia Ins
 titute of Technology. The grammar is proposed as an open-ended set of shap
 e rules that is readily expanded to complete the sets of design variations
  documented in the archive\, along with several possible ones that can be 
 in principle generated by the evolving grammar. Significantly\, all new sh
 ape rules are introduced seamlessly\, as an intrinsic part of the design p
 rocess of the evolving grammar\, without requiring reformatting of existin
 g rules or advocating the design of a singular Miesian grammar.\n\nThe wor
 k aims to provide (a) a generative model of Mies’ courthouse design lang
 uage\; (b) an automated completion of some of the rudimentary sketches\, d
 iagrams and drawings in the Mies Archive at MoMA\; (c) a prototype of an i
 nteractive design system for courthouse design that architects\, designers
  and stakeholders of courthouse architecture can evaluate for practical us
 e\; and (d) some speculations on the transformative role of the proposed c
 omputational method in bridging the gap between sketching and drafting in 
 the digital workflows of architects and designers.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://

 Evolutionary Transitions in Individuality (ETIs) describe the history of t
 he increasing complexity of life and the emergence of hierarchical organiz
 ation in an elegant framework. Each transition is characterized by a group
  of independent individuals coming together and forming a group that event
 ually can undergo Darwinian evolution and turns into a new individual leve
 l. One of the prominent examples of ETIs is the emergence of multicellular
 ity. In this thesis\, I address two key questions about the transition to 
 multicellularity: The emergence of heritability of higher-level traits and
  its relationship to cell-level traits. First\, I discuss how the heritabi
 lity of newly-formed group traits emerges as groups emerge. We introduce a
  simple theoretical model for calculating group-level trait heritability\,
  where the trait is the linear function of a cell-level trait. For cases i
 n which the relationship is more complex than a linear function\, we devel
 oped a statistical simulation to model and explore different kinds of anal
 ytical functions based on biological examples of relationship between cell
 -level traits and collective-level traits. Finally\, using the snowflake y
 east model system we did an experiment that shows an ecologically relevant
 \, emergent trait in a nascent multicellular organism can have a higher he
 ritability across a range of conditions than the unicellular-level trait o
 n which it is based. The evolution of complex multicellularity presents an
  apparent paradox: nascent multicellular organisms are thought to require 
 (relatively) large size to evolve complex traits\, but at the same time ma
 intaining large size requires complex organization at the cell and group l
 evels. This poses a chicken and egg problem between large size and cellula
 r development. Here\, we show that over the course of a year snowflake yea
 st can increase its size multiple orders of magnitude with minimal change 
 at the cell level by taking advantage of the physical properties of granul
 ar entangled materials. These results suggest that in the same way that ph
 ysically imposed geometric constraints can limit the size of clusters\, an
 -other innovations can lead to the emergence of a new biophysical mechanis
 m that changes the material properties of the clusters.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  ht

 tion Abstract:\n\nShape grammar interpreters have been studied for more th
 an forty years addressing several areas of design research including archi
 tectural\, engineering\, and product design. At the core of all these impl
 ementations\, the operation of embedding – the ability of a shape gramma
 r interpreter to search for subshapes in a geometry model even if they are
  not explicitly encoded in the database of the system – resists a genera
 l solution. It is suggested here that beyond a seemingly long list of tech
 nological hurdles\, the implementation of shape embedding\, that is\, the 
 implementation of the mathematical concept of the “part relation” betw
 een two shapes\, or equivalently\, between two drawings\, or between a sha
 pe and a design\, is the single major obstacle to take on.\n\nThis researc
 h identifies five challenges underlying the implementation of shape embedd
 ing and shape grammar interpreters at large: 1) complex entanglement of th
 e calculations required for shape embedding and a shape grammar interprete
 r at large\, with those required by a CAD system for modeling and modifyin
 g geometry\; 2) accumulated errors caused by the modeling processes of CAD
  systems\; 3) accumulated errors caused by the complex calculations requir
 ed for the derivation of affine\, and mostly\, perspectival transformation
 s\; 4) limited support for indeterminate shape embedding\; 5) low performa
 nce of the current shape embedding algorithms for models consisting of a l
 arge number of shapes.\n\nThe dissertation aims to provide a comprehensive
  engineering solution to all these five challenges above. More specificall
 y\, the five contributions of the dissertation are: 1) a new architecture 
 to separate the calculations required for the shape embedding and replacem
 ent (appropriately called here Shape Machine) vs. the calculations require
 d by a CAD system for the selection\, instantiation\, transformation\, and
  combination of shapes in CAD modeling\; 2) a new modeling calibration sys
 tem to ensure the effective translation of geometrical types of shapes to 
 their maximal representations without cumulative calculating errors\; 3) a
  new dual-mode system of the derivation of transformations for shape embed
 ding\, including a geometric approach next to the known algebraic one\, to
  implement the shape embedding relation under the full spectrum of linear 
 transformations without the accumulated errors caused by the current algor
 ithms\; 4) a new multi-step mechanism that resolves all cases of indetermi
 nate embeddings for shapes having fewer registration points than those req
 uired for a shape embedding under a particular type of transformation\; an
 d 5) a new data representation for hyperplane intersections\, the registra
 tion point signature\, to allow for the effective calculation of shape emb
 eddings for complex drawings consisting of a large number of shapes. All m
 odules are integrated into a common computational framework to test the mo
 del for a particular type of shapes – the shapes consisting of lines in 
 the Euclidean plane in the algebra U 12.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.

 \, Ph.D. (Georgia Tech)\n\nTitle: Identifying the Neural Mechanisms of Zon
 e State Performance using Time-varying Functional Connectivity Methods.\n\
 nAbstract:\n\nTo successfully achieve our goals and perform optimally in m
 any tasks\, we need to control our attention and sustain it. Some people t
 hink of attention as a light switch – it’s either on or off\, but a be
 tter metaphor is to equate attention to a candle that flickers –even whe
 n it is lit\, its flame varies. This is reflected in subjective accounts o
 f people claiming to feel focused or “in the zone” from one moment to 
 being “zoned-out” in another. Early studies of sustained attention usi
 ng fMRI compute correlation across the duration of the scan for regions of
  the brain which can last from minutes up to an hour. This assumption is p
 roblematic because like a flickering candle\, researchers have found evide
 nce of moment-to-moment fluctuations in the neural systems of attention (C
 hang & Glover\, 2010\; Majeed et al.\, 2011\; Liu & Dyun\, 2013). As a res
 ult\, there has been contradictive studies claiming that large-scale netwo
 rks like default mode network (DMN) and task positive network (TPN) can bo
 th support and be detrimental to performance.\n\nTo tackle this limitation
 \, this study will employ two methods of time-varying functional connectiv
 ity\, co-activation patterns (CAPs) and quasi periodic-pattern (QPP) to ex
 amine the interaction between the large-scale brain networks that are invo
 lved in zone state performance during a finger tapping task. The first lev
 el of analysis\, using CAPs\, aims to investigate moment-to-moment fluctua
 tions in the attention networks within an individual. The main prediction 
 is that there will be certain brain states that are more prevalent in in-t
 he-zone epochs and others that are more prevalent in out-of-the-zone epoch
 s. The second level analysis\, using QPP\, seeks to identify differences i
 n stable performance versus unstable performance across time within an ind
 ividual. I hypothesize that DMN and the TPN will be more anti-correlated i
 n in-the-zone runs than out-of-the-zone runs within a subject.\n\nIf the r
 esults are as predicted\, it elucidates how inter-regional functional conn
 ectivity supports sustained attention within an individual. This can lead 
 us to a better neural mechanistic understanding of what facilitates attent
 ion in order to achieve better performance.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gate

 tion for Control of Infinite Dimensional Systems in Robotics\, Fluid Mecha

 ght/Guggenheim 317 and on BlueJeans: [1]\n\nAbstract\nThe majority of syst
 ems in nature have a spatio-temporal dependence and can be described by Pa
 rtial Differential Equations (PDEs). They are ubiquitous in science and en
 gineering\, and are of rising interest among the control\, robotics\, and 
 machine learning communities. Related methods usually treat these infinite
  dimensional problems in finite dimensions with reduced order models. This
  leads to committing to specific approximation schemes and the subsequent 
 control laws cannot generalize outside of the approximation schemes. Addit
 ionally\, related work does not consider spatio-temporal descriptions of n
 oise that realistically represent the stochastic nature of physical system
 s. This thesis develops a variety of approaches for control optimization a
 nd co-design optimization for PDE and stochastic PDE (SPDE) systems from a
  unified perspective that can be applied to macroscopic systems in robotic
 s and fluid dynamics\, as well as microscopic systems in quantum mechanics
 . These approaches are each developed completely in the infinite dimension
 al Hilbert spaces where the systems are mathematically described\, enablin
 g the frameworks to be agnostic to the discretization scheme used to imple
 ment them. The first three developed approaches are applied in simulation 
 to classical systems in fluid mechanics such as the Heat and Burgers equat
 ion. The fourth approach is developed for second-order SPDEs that arise in
  robotic systems\, and are applied in simulation to systems in soft-roboti
 cs such as the Euler-Bernoulli equation and a biological model of a soft-r
 obotic limb. Finally\, several approaches are developed in the context of 
 quantum feedback control of open quantum systems with non-demolition measu
 rement\, and one such approach is applied in simulation to perform explici
 t feedback control of the two qubit open quantum system.\n\nCommittee\n\n-
