 \nTackling the Cocktail Party Problem for Hearing Devices: Solutions\, Cha
 llenges and Opportunities\nAbstract. The cocktail party problem has remain
 ed to be one of the most challenging problems for hearing devices even aft
 er decades of extensive research. In this talk\, we will introduce and dis
 cuss our research on the multi-microphone speech enhancement with an empha
 sis on robust and practical real-time algorithms for hearing devices. We w
 ill first present our research on multiple-microphone speech enhancement u
 sing a microphone array alone. Secondly\, we will present our latest resea
 rch on the multimodal speech enhancement using both brain signals (i.e. EE
 G) and microphone signals in a single joint-optimization framework. In bot
 h cases\, we will use objective and subjective evaluation to demonstrate t
 he algorithms’ effectiveness. Finally\, we will discuss the challenges a
 nd opportunities in deploying these algorithms in the real-world.\n\nBiogr
 aphy.\n\nTao Zhang received his B.S. degree in physics from Nanjing Univer
 sity\, Nanjing\, China in 1986\, M.S. degree in electrical engineering fro
 m Peking University\, Beijing\, China in 1989\, and Ph.D. degree in speech
  and hearing science from the Ohio-State University\, Columbus\, OH\, USA 
 in 1995. He joined the Advanced Research Department at Starkey Laboratorie
 s\, Inc. as in 2001 and since 2014\, he has been Director of the Signal Pr
 ocessing Research department at Starkey Hearing Technologies. He is a seni
 or member of IEEE and the Signal Processing Society and the Engineering in

 ree food\nStatus: published\n\nABSTRACT\n\nOne of the most important scien
 tific and technological frontiers of our time is the interfacing of electr
 onics with the human brain. This endeavour promises to help understand how
  the brain works and deliver new tools for diagnosis and treatment of path
 ologies including epilepsy and Parkinson’s disease. Current solutions\, 
 however\, are limited by the materials that are brought in contact with th
 e tissue and transduce signals across the biotic/abiotic interface. Recent
  advances in organic electronics have made available materials with a uniq
 ue combination of attractive properties\, including mechanical flexibility
 \, mixed ionic/electronic conduction\, enhanced biocompatibility\, and cap
 ability for drug delivery. I will present examples of novel devices for re
 cording and stimulation of neurons and show that organic electronic materi
 als offer tremendous opportunities to study the brain and treat its pathol
 ogies.\n\nABOUT THE SPEAKER\n\nGeorge Malliaras is the Prince Philip Profe
 ssor of Technology at the University of Cambridge. He received a PhD from 
 the University of Groningen and did a postdoc at the IBM Almaden Research 
 Center. Before joining Cambridge\, he was a faculty member at Ecole des Mi
 nes de St. Etienne and at Cornell University\, and served as the Director 
 of the Cornell NanoScale Facility. His research has been recognized with a
 wards from the New York Academy of Sciences\, the US National Science Foun
 dation\, and DuPont. He is a Fellow of the Materials Research Society and 
 of the Royal Society of Chemistry.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.edu/no

 iophysics\n\nAbstract:\n\nEnabling researchers\, by giving them access to 
 the tools\, technology\, and techniques\, is the key component to facilita
 ting the innovations of modern research. High-performance and high-through
 put computing are very important tools in modern research and are essentia
 l to making meaningful process on many important problems.\n\nIn this semi
 nar\, lessons learned in the course of serving a large and vibrant computa
 tional research community is described. Examples of troubleshooting and op
 timization of serial and parallel programs are shown. In addition\, the us
 e of optimization and benchmarking is used to show how technical data can 
 be developed to guide users in determination of their research resource re
 quirements and use. An example of using containerization technology to ena
 ble a specialized software stack is also detailed. In conclusion\, some of
  the lessons learned and skills developed during the previous 4 years will
  be shared.\n\nBiography:\n\nDr. Christopher Blanton is an experienced HPC
  professional who has worked with some of the most exciting and innovative
  computational researchers.\n\nHe earned his Ph.D. from Syracuse Universit
 y in Computational and Theoretical Chemistry. During his studies\, he firs
 t became deeply interested in computational research and HPC. After gradua
 tion\, he joined the Pennsylvania State University's Institute for CyberSc
 ience. Dr. Blanton has worked most closely with members of the materials s
 cience community\, as a co-appointed staff member of the Materials Researc
 h Institute and the Institute for CyberScience as well as serving as an IC
 S Associate and member of the ICS Coordinating Committee. He looks forward
  to sharing some of his experiences with the Georgia Institute of Technolo
 gy's computational research community.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.ed

 embrane Biophysics\n\nAbstract:\n\nModern advanced computing has allowed s
 cientists to apply a “computational microscope” to numerous biological
  systems and uncover their physical underpinnings in a manner not feasible
  on smaller computing resources. This seminar will detail the use of super
 computers\, including XSEDE’s Bridges and D.E. Shaw Research’s Anton2\
 , both located at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center\, to conduct large-
 scale simulations of lipid bilayers. Why advanced computing resources were
  necessary will be discussed\, as will steps taken to maximize the computa
 tional efficiency of these simulations.\n\nThis approach\, at the nexus of
  computational science\, physics\, chemistry\, and biology\, may be employ
 ed to understand the behavior of cell membranes\, the lipid bilayers that 
 form the boundary of living cells and control their interaction with the s
 urrounding world. Lipid rafts\, regions of the membrane with distinct phys
 ical properties\, may be modeled in a system of coexisting liquid phases a
 nd simulated by Molecular Dynamics. Extracting lipid physical properties f
 rom the studies’ numerical data revealed new insights into coupling of l
 ipid rafts and communication across the membrane.\n\nBiography:\n\nDr. Mic
 hael Weiner received his undergraduate degree in physics from Yale Univers
 ity and his doctorate\, also in physics\, from Cornell University. He comp
 leted his doctoral research in computational biophysics in the laboratory 
 of Gerald Feigenson\, where he focused on Molecular Dynamics simulations o
 f the biophysical chemistry of lipid bilayers as models of cell membranes.
  Dr. Weiner is interested applying advanced computing techniques to questi
 ons throughout the sciences.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.edu/node/621

 \nBiomaterials-based Optical Metabolite Sensing\n\nFriday June 21st\, 2019
  Noon-1pm\; Room 3029 3rd Floor Krone EBB (with Pizza)\nProfessor Mike McS
 hane\, Department Head\, Biomedical Engineering\, Texas A&M University\nPe
 rsonal health monitoring is becoming increasingly accessible as the ease o
 f producing low-cost\, low-power embedded systems has fueled a rapid growt
 h in consumer products aimed at “measuring me.” Yet\, a major technolo
 gy gap is in the space of continuous chemical sensing. The majority of thi
 s talk will focus on describing our materials-focused solutions and relate
 d optical instrumentation aimed at closing this gap\; it will also describ
 e examples of how the same technology is being applied to various other ap
 plications\, particularly bioreactors for cell manufacturing to and tumor-
 egg models. Our research emphasis has been towards developing miniature\, 
 injectable biosensor implants with microscale and nanoscale organization t
 o enable observation of interstitial biochemistry. These materials provide
  specificity through use of various receptors and enhance sensitivity thro
 ugh optical amplification by phosphorescence or Raman scattering. Further\
 , they employ materials that can integrate naturally with tissue\, such as
  porous gels\, enhancing prospects for accurate\, rapid response and long-
 term monitoring. These studies pave the way for modular sensing systems ba
 sed on sensing microdomains embedded in hydrogels\; the former serve as th
 e selective responsive elements whereas the latter act to immobilize the s
 ensing domains while providing a “friendly” surface to interface with 
 the body. Prototype miniaturized\, dedicated instrumentation to interrogat
 e the implants will also be discussed. Examples of current and potential t
 ranslational activities will be provided and some major remaining challeng
 es to long-term in vitro and in vivo biochemical monitoring will be highli
 ghted.\n\nDr. Mike McShane is James J. Cain Professor II in Biomedical Eng
 ineering at Texas A&M University\, where he serves as Department Head and 
 is also affiliated with Materials Science & Engineering and the Center for
  Remote Health Technologies and Systems. Prof McShane’s primary research
  interests are in biomedical instrumentation and optics\, biosensor techno
 logy\, and biomaterials with emphasis on micro/nanofabrication for respons
 ive materials. In this work\, he has pioneered the use of micro/nanopartic
 les\, capsules\, and hydrogel-particle composites for development of optic
 al biosensing systems and has assisted in commercialization of related pro
 ducts. Professor McShane is a fellow of AIMBE and is a Senior Member of SP
 IE and also IEEE\, for which he has served in numerous elected and appoint

 \n\nEarly registration is open for REU students until May 31. Ask your REU
  adviser for the registration link.\n\nThe College of Sciences and iGniTe 
 Summer Launch Program present "Halloween in June\," a costume party and va
 riety show to celebrate the International Year of the Periodic Table of Ch
 emical Elements.\n\nCome in your best costumes inspired by the periodic ta
 ble or chemical elements. Winners of various categories will receive fabul
 ous prizes.\n\nPulsate to the science rock music of Leucine Zipper and the
  Zinc Fingers (LZZF)\nPunk-rock music and science share similar goals—to
  go boldly (loudly?) where no person has gone before. Leucine Zipper and T
 he Zinc Fingers (LZZF) amalgamate music and science as a synthetic cross-d
 isciplinary project to bring science to the people in a decidedly original
  medium.\n\nThis ain’t your typical outreach education or NSF broader-im
 pacts initiative. This is loud-and-proud and scientifically sound rock and
  roll! LZZF performs original rock songs\, and a few select cover-songs\, 
 that are ALL ABOUT SCIENCE! Their songs feature biofilms\, enzymes\, dinos
 aurs\, entropy\, social insects\, and more.\n\nActual scientists (three of
  four are Georgia Tech faculty) and life-long punk rockers compose the ban
 d\, so you can be sure that the lyrics are scientifically valid\, and the 
 tunes are rabidly arousing. See them live and enjoy the spectacle of Earth
 's first genetically modified rock band!\n\nThe band has performed around 
 Atlanta since 2014 and released their first album Atomic Anarchy\, to grea
 t critical acclaim\, in 2018.\n\nThe band’s sound calls to mind the Ramo
 nes\, Joan Jett\, Kiss\, or Iggy Pop. That is\, if those icons wrote songs
  about enzymes… – Carmen Drahl\, Chemical and Engineering News [1]\, 9
 /30/2018\n\nAnd as if the second song on their debut CD Atomic Anarchy\, 
 “We’re a Science Band” didn’t make it clear enough\, their songs a
 re all sort of about science\, and science accessories. But they sure don
 ’t sound like they were cooked up in a sterile lab. Nah\, they kick it o
 ut like they’ve spent years honing their three chords in garages and bas
 ements like all good bands do\, with an uncomplicated\, Ramones-worthy\, g
 et in/get out\, old school punk style.” – Jeff Clark\, Stomp and Stamm
 er [2]\, 10/4/2018\n\nWallow in the dirty science of "Carbon and Cubic Fec
 es" with David Hu\nDavid Hu is an IgNobel Prize winner\, mechanical engine
 ering professor at Georgia Tech\, and author of "How to Walk on Water and 
 Climb Up Walls: Animal Movement and the Robots of the Future."\n\nHuman wa
 ste has substantial resource value: human urine contains phosphorus\, pota
 ssium\, nitrogen\; and human feces contains mostly carbon. David will talk
  about the physics of excretion. In the law of urination\, he will show th
 at animals urinate for a constant duration\, independent of body mass. In 
 their study of cubic feces of the wombat\, he will show how soft intestine
 s can form corners in feces.\n\nLaugh out loud with Lew Lefton's science h
 umor\nLew Lefton is a faculty member in the Georgia Tech School of Mathema
 tics\, the assistant dean of information technology for the Georgia Tech C
 ollege of Sciences\, and associate vice president for research computing a
 t Georgia Tech. With so many roles\, he is a very important person.\n\nBut
  Lew is not just your ordinary VIP or computing/mathematics geek. He's an 
 accomplished and experienced comedian who has done stand up and improv com
 edy with a geeky twist for over 30 years. His unique talents are best summ
 ed up by his business card\, which reads: Lew Lefton\, Mathematician/Comed
 ian\, "He's funny and he can prove it."\n\nMarvel at magic card trick and 
 treats by Matt Baker\nMatt Baker is an internationally renowned Georgia Te
 ch mathematics professor by day and an accomplished magician [3] by night.
  Matt currently serves as associate dean for faculty development in the Ge
 orgia Tech College of Sciences.\n\nAs a magician Matt has performed three 
 times at the invitation-only Fechter’s Finger Flicking Frolic [4]\, the 
 world’s premiere close-up magic convention. In 2018 he recorded a Pengui
 n Live Acts show and lecture in Columbus\, Ohio\, and spent four days in S
 pain studying with Juan Tamariz [5]\, the world’s greatest living close-
 up magician. In July 2019\, Matt will be lecturing at the International Br
 otherhood of Magicians Annual Convention [6] in Scottsdale\, Arizona.\n\nM
 att’s awards for magic include the Atlanta Society of Magicians' Top Dog
  Award and the Greater Atlanta Magician of the Year award.\n\nMatt's magic
  tricks have appeared in several national periodicals. He just published h
 is first book of original magic\, " The Buena Vista Shuffle Club [7]." Wor
 ld-renowned magician Joshua Jay [8] calls it "an excellent\, funny\, and p

 ating micron sized objects in magnetic liquids in a continuous flow throug
 h so-called “ferrohydrodynamics” is a relatively new research field. I
 t has resulted in label-free manipulation techniques in microfluidic syste
 ms and exciting applications such as circulating tumor cells (CTCs) enrich
 ment. It is the goal of this talk to introduce the fundamental principles 
 of ferrohydrodynamics and its recent applications in microfluidic enrichme
 nt of CTCs developed in my lab. The theoretical background of two commonly
  used specificities of manipulation in magnetic liquids will be discussed\
 , including the size and contrast of magnetic property. Pros and cons of c
 ommonly used media of magnetic liquids including paramagnetic salt solutio
 ns and ferrofluids will be introduced. Details of CTCs enrichment applicat
 ion will also be discussed.\n\nBiography: Leidong Mao is a Professor in th
 e School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Georg
 ia in Athens\, GA. He received his PhD in electrical engineering from Yale
  University. He is interested in developing new microfluidic technologies 
 for biological or biomedical applications such as cancer cell isolation an

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\nStatus: published\n\nThe Web
  of Brilliance ERG and Institute Diversity present the workshop "Introvers
 ion as an Ally\," with Neith Sankofa.\n\nInteracting with leaders and infl
 uencers across many social and cultural lines is a marker of a seasoned pr
 ofessional. Being able to be present\, flexible and “in-the-moment” wh
 ile doing so is a marker of a fully empowered\, exceptional professional.\
 n\nBut what happens when there are challenges… like being an introvert? 
 It begins with recognizing introversion as an ally to the type of insights
  that create full empowerment because of an introvert’s innate ability t
 o be or become internally aware.\n\nIn this workshop participants will rec
 ognize when they (and others) have switched to “automatic” in their in
 teractions. Through integration exercises\, participants will uncover how 
 to counterbalance the tendency to fall into unconscious role-playing (due 
 to the stress of introversion) by authentically engaging their target audi
 ences for maximum success. By getting in touch with what they need and fee
 l\, and creating a toolkit for counterbalancing\, they will begin to creat
 e more ideal conditions for themselves in any situation through expanded i
 nternal awareness.\n\nFree and open to Georgia Tech Staff and Faculty\, bu
 t seats are very limited. You must register to attend.\n\nRefreshments pro
 vided. Introverts\, Extroverts\, and everyone in between are welcome.\n\nR

 Near-Field Integrated Magnetic Sensing System for Hardware Security\n\nSpe
 aker: Professor Mai-Khanh N. Nguyen\, VLSI Design and Education Center (VD
 EC)\, The University of Tokyo\, JAPAN\n\nAbstract: Hardware Trojan or spyw
 are circuits operating as hardware backdoors can be implemented and integr
 ated into computer chips\, smart-cards\, and other crypto processors. Hard
 ware Trojan circuits inside a chip is generally harmless in normal operati
 on until they get triggered by a preset internal or external signal to ste
 al data or override and even control the system. Detection of hardware Tro
 jans is very difficult as they are normally in nano-scale sizes and integr
 ated into ICs with high complexity system inside and a huge number of gate
 s. Therefore\, Trojan inspection through destructive reverse engineering m
 ay not ensure the absence of hardware Trojans. In this talk\, I present a 
 demonstration to non-invasively detect hardware Trojan\, analyze and ident
 ify vulnerable portions of cryptographic chips based on magnetic sensing t
 owards cybersecurity applications.\n\nSpeaker Bio: Dr. Mai-Khanh is curren
 tly is an assistant professor at VLSI Design and Education Center (VDEC)\,
  the University of Tokyo\, Japan. He received the Ph.D. degree in Electric
 al Engineering and Information Systems\, The University of Tokyo\, Japan i

  2013 in VDEC. His research interests include integrated RF/mm-Wave circui
 ts\, and magnetic sensing. He is a recipient of Best Paper Awards of the A
 sian Symposium on Quality Electronic Design Symp. in 2010\, the third rank
  of the 9th IEEE NEWCAS 2011\, and of IEEE NEWCAS 2017. He servered as a T

 \, Public\, Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\nStatus: draft\n\nGl
 en Evenbly\nSchool of Physics\, Georgia Tech\nAbstract: Quantum many-body 
 systems are difficult to study because the space of possible many-body sta
 tes is huge: its dimension grows exponentially in the system size. However
 \, thanks to quantum information theory\, progress in understanding the ro
 le of entanglement in quantum many-body systems has revealed that only a s
 mall region of this huge state space is needed for describing relevant qua
 ntum states. Tensor networks\, originally developed in the context of cond
 ensed-matter physics and based on renormalization group ideas\, exploit th
 is understanding of entanglement in order to provide efficient description
 s of many-body quantum states. In this talk I will (i) review our current 
 understanding of many-body entanglement\, (ii) introduce tensor networks a
 s tools for the study of many body systems\, and (iii) give an overview of
  the exciting developments within the tensor network program.\n\nBio: Glen
  Evenbly received the PhD degree in physics from the University of Queensl
 and\, Australia in 2010. His research focuses on the development of novel 
 theoretical and numerical tools for modelling entanglement in quantum syst
 ems. He joined Caltech in 2011 as the Sherman-Fairchild Prize postdoctoral
  fellow and UC Irvine in 2014 as a Simons Foundation postdoctoral fellow\,
  where he continued his work on quantum information and many-bodyphysics. 
 He joined the faculty at the University of Sherbrooke\, Canada in 2016 bef
 ore joining the School of Physics at Georgia Tech in 2019. Glen received t
 he IUPAP Young Scientist Prize in Computational Physics in 2017 for his ex
 ceptional work on developing the tensor network formalism.\n\nLight refres

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Public\, Undergraduate stud
 ents\nStatus: published\n\nSpeaker: Professor Chien-Chung Lin\, National C
 hiao-Tung University & ITRI\, Taiwan\n\nAbstract:\n\nColloidal Quantum Dot
 s (CQDs) have been working their ways into the next-generation photonic de
 vices. Highly efficient light emitters and absorbers made of CQDs can be d
 emonstrated among various types of materials including CdSe/CdS/CdTe and p
 erovskites. The wavelength tunability\, according to their physical sizes\
 , can be readily suitable for LED displays and solar spectrum management p
 urposes. Meanwhile\, the reliability of these nanocrystals remains one of 
 the most important issues before their full-scale commercialization. In th
 is talk\, we will present our latest work on the improvement of the reliab
 ility of hybrid CQD photonic devices. A brief review on previous achieveme
 nts will also be provided. The compact package and long lifetime features 
 will be the key factors for future successful deployment of such materials
  and devices.\n\nSpeaker's Biography:\n\nDr. Chien-Chung Lin was born in T
 aipei\, Taiwan\, in 1970. He received his B.S.E.E. degree from National Ta
 iwan University\, Taipei\, in 1993\, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in ele
 ctrical engineering from Stanford University\, Stanford\, CA\, USA\, in 19
 97 and 2002\, respectively. His thesis work focused on design\, modeling\,
  and fabrication of micromachined-tunable optoelectronic devices. He joine
 d E2O Communications Inc.\, Calabasas\, CA\, USA\, as a Senior Optoelectro
 nic Engineer in 2002. His main research interests then were in optically a
 nd electrically pumped long-wavelength vertical cavity surface emitting la
 sers. In 2004\, he joined Santur Corporation\, Fremont\, CA\, where he ini
 tially worked as a member of technical staff and became a Manager of Laser
  Chip Engineering later. He had worked on monolithic multi-wavelength DFB 
 Laser arrays for data and telecommunications\, yield and reliability analy
 sis of DFB Laser arrays\, etc. In2009\, he joined the National Chiao Tung 
 University (NCTU) in Tainan\, Taiwan\, where he currently holds the positi
 on of a full Professor. His major research interests are in the design and
  fabrication of novel semiconductor optoelectronic devices\, including LED
 s\, solar cells\, and lasers. Since 2016\, he has been jointly appointed b
 y the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI)\, where he participa
 tes in and leads several key projects in micro-LEDs\, 3D ICs\, and silicon
  photonics. Prof. Lin has published more than 200 journal and conference p
 apers and is a senior member of the IEEE and the Optical Society of Americ
 a.\n\n(Pizzas will be served after the seminar presentation)\n\nLinks:\n[0

 omputing at Georgia Tech and Director of the GVU Center. His research inte
 rests focus primarily on driving human-centered concerns into core computi
 ng infrastructure. He is a pioneer in the exploration of human-centered pe
 rspectives on computer networking\, particularly in the home and has been 
 active in developing more usable approaches to information security system
 s. Lately\, his research has expanded into a number of explorations of the
  social impacts of computing technology\, and understanding how technology
  can support the work of non-profits and NGOs. While he is a technologist 
 at heart\, he enjoys working with designers\, as well as ethnographers and
  other social scientists.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.edu/node/624527

 ls Processing Fundamentals for the Self-Aligned Capillarity Assisted Litho
 graphy for Electronics (SCALE) Process Lorraine F. Francis - Professor and
  3M Chair in Experiential Learning University of Minnesota Department of C
 EMS\n\nAbstract:\n\nApplications for circuits and devices printed on flexi
 ble substrates abound\, ranging from wearable diagnostic sensors to large 
 area\, roll-up displays. Continuous printing processes are attractive for 
 manufacturing flexible electronics. However\, two challenges typically ari
 se in this pursuit: (1) creating small feature sizes\, and (2) achieving r
 egistration of multiple functional layers. This presentation will cover ou
 r efforts to address these challenges using a new approach – Self-Aligne
 d Capillarity-Assisted Lithography for Electronics (or SCALE). SCALE invol
 ves imprinting a multilevel open network of reservoirs\, capillaries and d
 evice structures into a UV-curable coating deposited on a flexible substra
 te\, delivering electronically functional inks into the reservoirs by inkj
 et printing\, and using capillarity to selectively fill capillaries and de
 vice structures attached to the reservoirs. The single imprint step create
 s all the structural features needed in the devices and capillary flow cre
 ates self-aligned\, multimaterial devices. To-date we have used SCALE to c
 reate conductive networks\, resistors\, capacitors\, diodes and transistor
 s. This presentation will show advances in device architecture and perform
 ance\, and explore the key processing steps. Special attention will be giv
 en to the continuous roll-to-roll imprinting process\, experiments and vis
 ualizations of liquid flow in open capillary channels\, and unique flow co
 ntrol methods such as a microfluidic diode.\n\nBiography:\n\nLorraine F. F
 rancis is Professor of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science and curr
 ently holds the 3M Chair in Experiential Learning in the College of Scienc
 e and Engineering at the University of Minnesota. She received a B.S. in C
 eramic Engineering from Alfred University in 1985\, and M.S. and Ph.D. in 
 Ceramic Engineering from the University of Illinois in 1987 and 1990\, res
 pectively. She then joined the University of Minnesota. Professor Francis 
 has research interests broadly in the area of materials processing\, inclu
 ding coating and printing processes and microstructure development studies
 . She is also very involved in undergraduate education\, including develop
 ing a project-based learning class for freshmen and authoring a textbook. 
 Professor Francis has received several awards. In 2019\, she was named Col
 lege of Science and Engineering Distinguished Professor\, and in 2014 she 
 received the Horace T. Morse - University of Minnesota Alumni Association

 \nMadhavan Swaminathan\nJohn Pippin Chair in Microsystems Packaging & Elec
 tromagnetics\nSchool of Electrical and Computer Engingeering\nAbstact: A c
 ombination of "Moore" (IC) and "More than Moore" (package) scaling has led
  to the shrinking of electronic systems over the last several decades. As 
 scaling continues beyond CMOS to include advanced devices\, scaling of the
  package needs to continue to enable system scaling\, leading to the integ
 ration and miniaturization of systems. This requires new technologies for 
 package integration which when connected to assembled ICs leads to System 
 on Package (SoP) solutions that have superior performance and size as comp
 ared to current technologies. This presentation will discuss advanced SoP 
 platforms for integration with a focus on heterogeneity for a variety of a
 pplications that include AI\, HPC\, Power Electronics\, mmWave to name a f
 ew. The inter-disciplinary nature of the research will be highlighted base
 d on faculty interactions between four different schools at GT.\n\nBio: Ma
 dhavan Swaminathan is the John Pippin Chair in Microsystems Packaging & El
 ectromagnetics in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) 
 with a joint appointment in the School of Materials Science and Engineerin
 g (MSE)\, and was recently appointed Director of the 3D Systems Packaging 
 Research Center (PRC)\, GT. He also serves as the Site Director for the NS
 F Center for Advanced Electronics through Machine Learning (CAEML). He for
 merly held the position of Founding Director\, Center for Co-Design of Chi
 p\, Package\, System (C3PS)\, Joseph M. Pettit Professor in Electronics in
  ECE and Deputy Director of the Packaging Research Center (NSF ERC)\, GT. 
 Prior to joining GT\, he was with IBM working on packaging for supercomput
 ers. He is the author of 500+ refereed technical publications\, holds 30 p
 atents\, primary author and co-editor of 3 books\, founder and co-founder 
 of two start-up companies\, and founder of the IEEE Conference Electrical 
 Design of Advanced Packaging and Systems (EDAPS)\, a premier conference sp
 onsored by the EPS society. He is an IEEE Fellow and has served as the Dis
 tinguished Lecturer for the IEEE EMC society. He received his MS/PhD degre

 udying CNS delivery systems\n\nABSTRACT\nThe central nervous system (CNS) 
 has a specialized vascular barrier\, the blood-brain barrier (BBB)\, which
  possesses a highly selective barrier function that restricts the permeabi
 lity of drugs\, leading to a high failure rate in the development of CNS t
 herapeutics. However\, it remains difficult with existing in vivo models t
 o conduct mechanistic studies of the barrier function and interactions wit
 h drugs at molecular and cellular levels. This challenge highlights the im
 portance of the development of in vitro models that mimic the physiologica
 l structure and function of the BBB. Despite various efforts\, physiologic
 ally relevant in vitro human BBB models capable of highly precise\, quanti
 tative analysis of drug delivery remain to be developed. In this study\, w
 e present a human BBB-on-a-chip designed to create a 3D astrocytic network
  with reduced reactive gliosis and polarized aquaporin-4\, critical featur
 es of the BBB that has yet to be demonstrated. Our model will provide a re
 liable tool for studying the penetrance of CNS drugs across the BBB.\n\nBI

 :\n\nWe have witnessed tremendous growth in Artificial Intelligence (AI) a
 nd machine learning (ML) recently. However\, research shows that AI and ML
  models are often vulnerable to adversarial attacks\, and their prediction
 s can be difficult to understand\, evaluate and ultimately act upon.\n\nDi
 scovering real-world vulnerabilities of deep neural networks and counterme
 asures to mitigate such threats has become essential to successful deploym
 ent of AI in security settings. We present our joint works with Intel whic
 h include the first targeted physical adversarial attack (ShapeShifter) th
 at fools state-of-the-art object detectors\; a fast defense (SHIELD) that 
 removes digital adversarial noise by stochastic data compression\; and int
 eractive systems (ADAGIO and MLsploit) that further democratize the study 
 of adversarial machine learning and facilitate real-time experimentation f
 or deep learning practitioners.\n\nFinally\, we also present how scalable 
 interactive visualization can be used to amplify people’s ability to und
 erstand and interact with large-scale data and complex models. We sample f
 rom projects where interactive visualization has provided key leaps of ins
 ight\, from increased model interpretability (Gamut with Microsoft Researc
 h)\, to model explorability with models trained on millions of instances (
 ActiVis deployed with Facebook)\, increased usability for non-experts abou
 t state-of-the-art AI (GAN Lab open-sourced with Google Brain\; went viral
 !)\, and our latest work Summit\, an interactive system that scalably summ
 arizes and visualizes what features a deep learning model has learned and 
 how those features interact to make predictions. We conclude by highlighti
 ng the next visual analytics research frontiers in AI.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\n
 Polo Chau is an Associate Professor of Computing at Georgia Tech. He co-di
 rects Georgia Tech's MS Analytics program. His research group bridges mach

 solving real world problems in cybersecurity\, human-centered AI\, graph v

SUMMARY:GVU Center Brown Bag: Richard DeMillo "Usability\, Privacy\, Cyber
 security and the Right to Vote: Why elections are not as simple as they se
 em"

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Public\
 , Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\nStatus: published\n\nAbstract
 :\n\nAll modern public elections in the United States use computers called
  voting machines to automate at least part of the voting process. Like all
  computers\, voting machines can be misprogrammed\, misconfigured\, misuse
 d and hacked. Poorly secured data\, open networks\, and aging computing eq
 uipment with known vulnerabilities to malware are all subject to attack. T
 here is substantial evidence that foreign adversaries have infiltrated Ame
 rican election systems and there is growing evidence that election results
  were affected. Federal agencies\, the Intelligence Community\, and congre
 ssional committees all agree that action is required. This talk will focus
  on the unique aspects of elections from a computing standpoint: (1) Why a
 re there not national standards? (2) What cybersecurity tools would make e
 lections more secure? (3) How does the right to a secret ballot affect ele
 ction technology? (4) What is the future of electronic voting in the state
  of Georgia?\n\nIn this talk I will pay special attention to usability and
  privacy problems and point out areas in which improved understanding of c
 ognitive limitations of voters can influence public policy. This work is b
 ased in part on a recent paper entitled “Ballot Marking Devices (BMDs) c
 annot assure the will of the voters\,” by Philip Stark\, Andrew Appel\, 
 and me. This paper can be downloaded here: [1]\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\nRichard 
 DeMillo is the Charlotte B. and Roger C. Warren Professor of Computing and
  Professor of Management\, former John P. Imlay Dean of Computing\, and Di
 rector of the Center for 21st Century Universities at the Georgia Institut
 e of Technology. Author of over 100 articles\, books\, and patents\, he ha
 s held academic positions at Purdue University\, the University of Wiscons
 in\, and the University of Padua. He directed the Computer and Computation
  Research Division of the National Science Foundation and was Hewlett-Pack
 ard's first Chief Technology Officer. He is the 2013 Lumina Foundation Ina
 ugural Fellow which recognized his founding of the Center for 21st Century
  Universities as a “unique institution.” He is also a Fellow of both t
 he American Association for the Advancement of Science and the Association
  for Computing Machinery. He is the author of the influential 2011 book 
 “Abelard to Apple: The Fate of American Colleges and Universities” and
  an award-winning 2015 sequel entitled “Revolution in Higher Education: 
 How a Small Band of Innovators will Make College Accessible and Affordable

 \nIgor Bargatin\nUniv. of Pennsylvania\, Mechanical Engineering and Applie
 d Mechanics\nAbstract: Recently\, we introduced the concept of plate mecha
 nical metamaterials—cellular plates with carefully controlled periodic g
 eometry and unique mechanical properties—as well as its initial realizat
 ion in the form of freestanding corrugated plates made out of an ultrathin
  film. We used atomic layer deposition (ALD) and microfabrication techniqu
 es to make robust plates out of a single continuous ALD layer with cm-scal
 e lateral dimensions and thicknesses between 25 and 100 nm\, creating the 
 thinnest freestanding plates that can be picked up by hand. We also fabric
 ated and characterized nanocardboard - plate metamaterials made from multi
 ple layers of nanoscale thickness\, whose geometry and properties are remi
 niscent of honeycomb sandwich plates or corrugated paper cardboard. Ultral
 ow weight\, mechanical robustness\, thermal insulation\, as well as chemic
 al and thermal stability of alumina make plate metamaterials attractive fo
 r numerous applications\, including structural elements in flying microrob
 ots and interstellar light sails\, high-temperature thermal insulation in 
 energy converters\, photophoretic levitation\, as well as ultrathin sensor
 s and resonators. I will briefly discuss our experimental progress on all 
 these applications\, including demonstrations of extremely robust thermal 
 insulators that can sustain a temperature difference of ~1000 K across a m
 icron-scale gap\, hollow AFM cantilevers that offer greatly enhanced sensi
 tivity and data acquisition rates\, and macroscopic plates that levitate w
 hen illuminated by light.\n\nBio: Igor Bargatin received his undergraduate
  degree in theoretical physics from the Lomonosov Moscow State University\
 , and a Ph.D. degree in physics and electrical engineering from the Califo
 rnia Institute of Technology\, Pasadena. After postdoctoral appointments a
 t LETI/Minatec (Grenoble\, France) and Stanford University\, he became the
  Class of 1965 Term Assistant Professor in the Department of Mechanical En
 gineering and Applied Mechanics (MEAM)\, University of Pennsylvania. Prof.
  Bargatin’s research interests are focused on micro- and nanomechanical 
 structures for new applications in energy conversion\, ultra-lightweight m
 aterials\, and new mechanisms of levitation. He is a recent recipient of t
 he NSF CAREER award and the Penn Engineering teaching award.\n\nLinks:\n[0

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Postdoc
 \, Public\, Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\nStatus: review\n\nS
 ince 2009 women have received a majority of the doctoral degrees granted b
 y U.S. institutions.In several scientific fields women have made great str
 ides\, whereas in a number of STEM areas the progress has been substantial
 ly slower.\n\nin 2017 women received 53% of the doctorates in Biological a
 nd Agricultural Sciences and 70% in the Health and Medical Sciences.In con
 trast\, women earned only 23% of the doctorates in engineering\, 25% in ma
 thematics and computer sciences\, and 34% in the physical and earth scienc
 es.\n\nOver the years\, the percentage of tenure-line female faculty membe
 rs in the physical sciences\, engineering\, and mathematics has remained l
 ow. Findings from an analysis of the responses to surveys and site visit d
 iscussions that involved over 1200 administrators\, chemistry and chemical
  engineering faculty members\, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows 
 will be discussed. The hiring rate of female faculty members and factors c
 ontributing to their career choices will also be addressed.\n\nReception f
 ollows in the atrium.\n\nAbout the Speaker\n\nValerie J. Kuck\, worked at 
 Bell Laboratories\, Lucent Technologies in Murray Hill\, New Jersey for 34
  years. Most of her research was focused on the stabilization of polyolefi
 ns used in copper insulate\, identification and application of high temper
 ature coatings for optical fibers and the development of new devices.\n\nW
 hile at Bell Labs she became active in the North Jersey Section of the Ame
 rican Chemical Society (ACS). Shortly thereafter\, she was elected to repr
 esent the section and serve as its representative to the national organiza
 tion. Subsequently\, she was appointed or elected to chair five national c
 ommittees. She was then elected to serve nine years on the ACS Board of Di
 rectors and chaired the Board Committee on Grants and Awards.\n\nAs a comm
 ittee chair\, she instituted a number of successful efforts. Those include
 d in having more talented women appointed to national committees and propo
 sed for leadership roles in the Society so that the number of women active
  in the Society reflected their distribution in the membership. She initia
 ted procedures to substantially increase the numbers of women nominated an
 d receiving national ACS awards\, especially those based on technical acco
 mplishments. She worked to enhance the Society’s efforts in supporting t
 he unemployed by originating and presenting workshops at Local\, Regional 
 and National meetings and serving as a career consultant.\n\nThose efforts
  led her to assist in the development of workshops that were presented at 
 many universities to assist graduate students and post-docs in planning fo
 r their careers. She proposed a new event\, Sci-Mix\, which is now the mos
 t attended session held at national meetings\, to facilitate chemists in m
 eeting others with similar technical interests. Twice she organized specia
 l symposia on very late breaking scientific discoveries. With no publicity
 \, those sessions drew collectively 10\,000 national meeting attendees and
  made the national news and were covered in the popular press. She also pu
 shed for enhanced laboratory safety training in academe along with greater
  access to safe chemical handling procedures.\n\nKuck has received several
  awards from Bell Labs and three national awards from the ACS for her lead
 ership\, dedication\, and numerous efforts to help women and others in adv
 ancing their careers. She was named a distinguished alumnus by Saint-Mary-
 of-the-Woods College\, and by her graduate school\, Purdue University. She
  has authored 41 publications and has been granted 25 U.S. patents.\n\nAbo
 ut the Phillips 66 / C.J. “Pete” Silas Program in Ethics and Leadershi
 p\n\nEthics\, leadership\, and quality\, grounded in strong communication 
 skills and professionalism\, are essential components of an engineering ed
 ucation. To spotlight the importance of these core values\, in 1995 the Ph
 illips Petroleum Foundation awarded a grant to the School of Chemical & Bi
 omolecular Engineering to develop the Phillips 66/C.J. “Pete” Silas Pr
 ogram in Ethics and Leadership.\n\nNamed in recognition of the outstanding
  professional achievements of Georgia Tech chemical engineering alumnus C.
 J. “Pete” Silas\, who retired from Phillips Petroleum as chairman and 
 CEO in 1994\, the program focuses on technical and business decisions that
  have ethical ramifications. These topics and related areas in engineering
 \, technology and ethics are integrated into the core chemical and biomole
 cular engineering curriculum and are addressed in an annual public symposi
 um featuring prominent industrialists and ethicists.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http:

 , Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\nStatus: published\n\nAbstract
 :\n\nPlaydate — a tiny\, yellow\, handheld game console — made a bigge
 r splash than its creators envisioned when it was announced this past May.
  Relying on a combination of old tech (a 1-bit black-and-white display)\, 
 new design (from Sweden’s renowned Teenage Engineering) and some just-pl
 ain-weird ideas (a side-mounted crank as a game controller)\, software mak
 er Panic Inc. hopes that Playdate can carve itself a niche in a video game
  marketplace where giants dominate. The story is still in-progress — Pla
 ydate won’t be released until next year — but Greg Maletic\, Panic’s
  Director of Special Projects\, will give you an insider’s peek at the d
 ecisions that have driven Playdate’s conception\, design\, manufacture\,
  and marketing.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\nGreg Maletic has had a varied career th
 at includes software development\, theme park design\, and consumer electr
 onics. Maletic currently is the Director of Special Projects at Panic Inc.
 \, where he leads a small team developing Playdate\, a new handheld video 
 game console shipping in 2020. Prior to Panic\, Greg worked with Walt Disn
 ey Imagineering\, developing attraction concepts and drawing illustrations
  for use in Disney theme parks. In 2007\, Maletic combined his love of fil
 m with his overwhelming interest in games and technology\, releasing the d
 ocumentary TILT: The Battle to Save Pinball. TILT chronicles the developme
 nt of “Pinball 2000”\, Bally/Williams last-ditch effort to save the dy
 ing pinball industry. Maletic’s early work experience is in software dev
 elopment and marketing\, first at Apple as a product manager for MacOS\, l
 ater as a co-founder of Zero G Software\, a software tools maker sold to M
 acrovision in 2005.\n\nSchedule of Brown Bag Speakers Fall 2019 [1]\n\nLin

 published\n\nA Frontiers in Science Lecture to celebrate 2019\, the Intern
 ational Year of the Periodic Table\nFor more than half a century\, dedicat
 ed and eager groups of scientists have contrived ways to introduce heavier
  and heavier elements into the universe. Their efforts finally completed t
 he seventh row of the famous—if poorly understood—periodic table of th
 e chemical elements.\n\nNow all 118 elements have names\, even though most
  spontaneously decay more quickly than you can say “Oganesson” or “L
 ivermorium.”\n\nWhat now? Continue? Try to start another row? Why? To wh
 at end\, and at what cost?\n\nThis talk will explore the economic\, societ
 al\, and scientific benefits and drawbacks inherent in this pursuit.\n\nAb
 out the Speaker\n\nMonica Halka [1] is an experimental physicist whose res
 earch focused on the interaction of light with atoms.\n\nShe has coauthore
 d a set of six volumes on the periodic table [2]\, which examines historic
 al\, astrophysical\, and practical observations about each of the chemical
  elements.\n\nShe serves as associate director of the Honors Program at Ge
 orgia Tech [3]\, where she teaches courses in optics\, energy science\, an
 d the nuclear age\, among others.\n\nAbout Frontiers in Science Lectures\n
 Lectures in this series are intended to inform\, engage\, and inspire stud

 and topics of general interest in the sciences and mathematics. Lecturers 
 tailor their talks for nonexpert audiences.\n\nAbout the Periodic Table Fr

 \nPrice Gilbert\, Jr. Chair in Regenerative Engineering and Medicine\nGeor
 gia Tech/Emory University\n\nMicrofluidics & International Research Collab
 orations\n\nThis seminars-plus-lunch program aims to catalyze scientific a
 nd cultural exchange between Georgia Tech students and 12 visiting undergr
 ads from Japan. It will also provide GaTech students a brief preview of a 
 planned international exchange program for summer 2020 and beyond. My pres
 entation will start with description of an interesting microfluidic phenom
 enon and its application to microfluidic sperm sorting used for in vitro f
 ertilization. This was an international industry-academia collaboration th
 at led to an FDA-cleared medical device that is used clinically.\n\nThe pr
 esentation will also describe a computer-controlled microfluidic pumping t
 echnology that was developed by an undergraduate student\, then applied to
  biomedical needs such as microfluidic embryo culture\, another device tha
 t has been tested clinically. A final microfluidic topic will be efforts\,
  including work by Ga Tech Undergrads\, to construct microscale intestine 
 models with human intestinal organoids and a microbiome.\nThe presentation
  will also give a short preview of two components of the planned exchange 
 program:\n\n(i) Mentoring opportunity for GRADUATE STUDENTS to host a Japa
 nese Undergrad Researcher for ~5 weeks in Aug/Sept 2020. Mentors will be i
 nvited to cultural exchange programs and also receive $3000 to be used for
  travel to scientific conferences or materials and supplies for the lab.\n
 \n(ii) Another component is an opportunity for Georgia Tech BME UNDERGRADS
  to do a fully-sponsored Global Internship Program (GIP) in Japan in summe
 r 2020 (mid May - July) doing research at leading Japanese Universities.\n
 \nAnna Liu\nPh.D. Candidate The Wallace H Coulter Department of Biomedical
  Engineering\nGeorgia Tech\n\nUltrafast Microfluidic Cell Compression for 
 Convective Intracellular Macromolecule Delivery\n\nEfficient intracellular
  delivery of target macromolecules remains a major obstacle in cell engine
 ering\, cell labeling\, and other biomedical applications. Our lab has dis
 covered the unique cell biophysical phenomenon of convective intracellular
  macromolecule delivery using mechanically induced\, transient cell volume
  exchange. Ultrafast microfluidic cell compressions are used to cause brie
 f\, deformation­induced cell volume loss followed by volume recovery thro
 ugh uptake of surrounding fluid. Macromolecules suspended in the surroundi
 ng fluid enter the cell on convective fluid currents. We harness this cell
  volume exchange behavior for high-throughput\, convective intracellular d
 elivery of large macromolecules\, including plasmids (>10 kb) and particle
 s (>30 nm)\, while maintaining high cell viability (>95%). Successful expe
 riments in transfection and intracellular labeling demonstrate potential t
 o overcome the most prohibitive challenges in intracellular delivery for c
 ell engineering.\n\nJenni Li\nUndergraduate Researcher\nGeorgia Tech\n\nIn
 vestigating Health Effects of Aerosol Particles on Single-cells in a High-
 throughput Air-liquid Interface Platform\n\nAir pollution and its detrimen
 tal health effects have been an increasingly alarming concern for the worl
 d. Cardiovascular diseases\, chronic respiratory diseases\, and different 
 types of cancers can all be linked to air pollution effects. Furthermore\,
  over 4 million people die per year from the direct effects of ambient par
 ticulate matter. One conventional method for studying the health effects o
 f aerosol particles is to collect particulate matter (PM) from the atmosph
 ere\, resuspend the PM in cell culture media\, add the PM/media to cell cu
 ltures\, and assess single cell oxidative stress. However\, this method do
 es not resemble the in vivo conditions of alveolar macrophages. Alveolar m
 acrophages are found in the alveoli of the lungs where the oxygen and carb
 on dioxide exchange between blood and air takes place and are a key cell t
 ype that is affected by PM. In this project\, we aim to create a microflui
 dic air-liquid interface environment that mimics how alveolar macrophages 
 are exposed to PM in order to study effects of PM at a single-cell level. 
 Utilizing a microfluidic platform provides uniform microenvironment and en
 ables high-throughput and high content single-cell analysis for hundreds o
 f cells. We adapted a previously developed microfluidic single-cell analys
 is technology and developed a method for exposing cells to an air-liquid i
 nterface. We then characterized cells by microscopy and LIVE/DEAD staining
  to assess if cells remain viable during air exposure. Following this vali
 dation of the air-liquid interface platform\, we will use it to study the 
 single cell responses of intracellular reactive oxygen species in exposure
  to aerosol particles.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.edu/node/625922#0\

 rero\, Ph.D.\nField Application Scientist\, Fluidigm Mass Cytometry\n\nHig
 h-dimensional single-cell analysis has become critical to basic and clinic
 al research. In traditional flow cytometry\, the spectral overlap between 
 fluorophores requires complicated data compensation and limits the number 
 of markers measured\, thus creating speed\, labor and reproducibility bott
 lenecks. Mass Cytometry overcomes these limitations by utilizing antibodie
 s labelled with rare earth metals. 2019 has been the most active year yet 
 in the mass cytometry community with over 200 publications to date. CyTOF
 ® technology has also been adopted by multiple consortia and in more than
  40 clinical trials.\nThe Helios™\, a CyTOF® system permits the analysi
 s of 37+ unique targets on a per-cell basis enabling unparalleled insight 
 into the phenotype and function of cell populations from normal and diseas
 ed states in a single tube. Additionally\, barcoding for Mass Cytometry al
 lows combining up to 20 samples in one tube for increased efficiency and t

 \nMicro-Physiological System Seminar Series—Microfluidic and Internation
 al Research Collaboration\nMicrofluidics & International Research Collabor
 ations --Shuichi Takayama\nThis seminars-plus-lunch program aims to cataly
 ze scientific and cultural exchange between Georgia Tech students and 12 v
 isiting undergrads from Japan. It will also provide GaTech students a brie
 f preview of a planned international exchange program for summer 2020 and 
 beyond. My presentation will start with description of an interesting micr
 ofluidic phenomenon and its application to microfluidic sperm sorting used
  for in vitro fertilization. This was an international industry-academia c
 ollaboration that led to an FDA-cleared medical device that is used clinic
 ally. The presentation will also describe a computer-controlled microfluid
 ic pumping technology that was developed by an undergraduate student\, the
 n applied to biomedical needs such as microfluidic embryo culture\, anothe
 r device that has been tested clinically. A final microfluidic topic will 
 be efforts\, including work by Ga Tech Undergrads\, to construct microscal
 e intestine models with human intestinal organoids and a microbiome.\n\nTh
 e presentation will also give a short preview of two components of the pla
 nned exchange program:\n(i) Mentoring opportunity for GRADUATE STUDENTS to
  host a Japanese Undergrad Researcher for ~5 weeks in Aug/Sept 2020. Mento
 rs will be invited to cultural exchange programs and also receive $3000 to
  be used for travel to scientific conferences or materials and supplies fo
 r the lab.\n(ii) Another component is an opportunity for Georgia Tech BME 
 UNDERGRADS to do a fully-sponsored Global Internship Program\n(GIP) in Jap
 an in summer 2020 (mid May - July) doing research at leading Japanese Univ
 ersities.\n\nUltrafast microfluidic cell compression for convective intrac
 ellular macromolecule delivery--Anna Liu\nEfficient intracellular delivery
  of target macromolecules remains a major obstacle in cell engineering\, c
 ell labeling\, and other biomedical applications. Our lab has discovered t
 he unique cell biophysical phenomenon of convective intracellular macromol
 ecule delivery using mechanically induced\, transient cell volume exchange
 . Ultrafast microfluidic cell compressions are used to cause brief\, defor
 mation­induced cell volume loss followed by volume recovery through uptak
 e of surrounding fluid. Macromolecules suspended in the surrounding fluid 
 enter the cell on convective fluid currents. We harness this cell volume e
 xchange behavior for high-throughput\, convective intracellular delivery o
 f large macromolecules\, including plasmids (>10 kb) and particles (>30 nm
 )\, while maintaining high cell viability (>95%). Successful experiments i
 n transfection and intracellular labeling demonstrate potential to overcom
 e the most prohibitive challenges in intracellular delivery for cell engin
 eering.\n\nInvestigating health effects of aerosol particles on single-cel
 ls in a high-throughput air-liquid interface platform --Jenni Li\nAir poll
 ution and its detrimental health effects have been an increasingly alarmin
 g concern for the world. Cardiovascular diseases\, chronic respiratory dis
 eases\, and different types of cancers can all be linked to air pollution 
 effects. Furthermore\, over 4 million people die per year from the direct 
 effects of ambient particulate matter. One conventional method for studyin
 g the health effects of aerosol particles is to collect particulate matter
  (PM) from the atmosphere\, resuspend the PM in cell culture media\, add t
 he PM/media to cell cultures\, and assess single cell oxidative stress. Ho
 wever\, this method does not resemble the in vivo conditions of alveolar m
 acrophages. Alveolar macrophages are found in the alveoli of the lungs whe
 re the oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange between blood and air takes plac
 e and are a key cell type that is affected by PM. In this project\, we aim
  to create a microfluidic air-liquid interface environment that mimics how
  alveolar macrophages are exposed to PM in order to study effects of PM at
  a single-cell level. Utilizing a microfluidic platform provides uniform m
 icroenvironment and enables high-throughput and high content single-cell a
 nalysis for hundreds of cells. We adapted a previously developed microflui
 dic single-cell analysis technology and developed a method for exposing ce
 lls to an air-liquid interface. We then characterized cells by microscopy 
 and LIVE/DEAD staining to assess if cells remain viable during air exposur

 \nThe Machine Learning Center at Georgia Tech invites you to a seminar by 
 Chandrajit Bajaj from the University of Texas.\n\nTITLE\nLearning the Koop
 man Operator for Dynamic Data\n\nABSTRACT\n\nRecent work in the study of d
 ynamic systems has focussed on data-driven decomposition techniques that a
 pproximate the action of the Koopman operator on observable functions of t
 he underlying phenomena.\n\nIn particular\, the data-driven method of dyna
 mic mode decomposition (DMD) has been explored\, with multiple variants of
  the algorithm in existence\, including extended DMD\, DMD in reproducing 
 kernel Hilbert spaces\, a Bayesian framework\, a variant for stochastic dy
 namical systems\, and a variant that uses deep neural networks.\n\nIn this
  talk\, I shall briefly summarize the large existing work on data-driven l
 earning of Koopman operator models\, and then describe new sampling-based 
 sketching approaches (SketchyCoreSVD\, SketchyCoreTucker) together with ma
 trix-valued Kernels\, to achieve accelerated Koopman operator approximatio
 ns of dynamic observable data. Examples are drawn from remote sensing and 
 FTIR hyperspectral tensor images\, bio-medical cardiac magnetic resonance 
 video\, and time series reactive flow simulations of a single ejector comb
 ustion process.\n\nBIO\nChandrajit Bajaj is the Computational Applied Math
 ematics Chair in Visualization\, professor of computer science\, and direc
 tor of the Center for Computational Visualization at the University of Tex
 as at Austin. Bajaj earned his undergraduate degree in electrical engineer
 ing from the Indian Institute of Technology\, and his master's and Ph.D. i
 n computer science from Cornell University. He is an IEEE\, ACM\, and AAAS
  Fellow\, and has won numerous best paper awards throughout his career. Ba
 jaj has also served as the editor of various publications including ACM Co
 mputing Survey\, SIAM Journal on Imaging Sciences\, and the International 
 Journal of Computational Geometry and Applications. He has authored severa
 l books [1].\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.edu/node/622930#0\n[1]  http

 the science of how we take in\, store\, and access information and trouble
 shoot what happens when students fail to learn. Come and find out how to f
 oster active learning with teaching practices that support what we know ab
 out the neuroscience of learning.\n\nPresented by\n\n- Mary Holder\, Ph.D.
  Academic Professional\, Neuroscience and Psychology\n- Carol Subiño Sull
 ivan\, Ph.D.\, Assistant Director\, Faculty Teaching and Learning Initiati
 ves\, Center for Teaching and Learning\n\nWorkshop Goals:\n\n- Explain the
  model of how memory works as applied to teaching choices and learning exp
 eriences.\n- Interpret and predict student outcomes through the lens of th
 e memory model in order to anticipate what went wrong in the learning expe
 rience.\n- Select teaching practices that intentionally enhance the learni
 ng experience based on the memory model.\n\nLunch will be provided. Please

 :\n\nDr. Berns will discuss how the domestic dog’s accessibility\, socia
 l intelligence\, and co-evolutionary history with humans provides a unique
  opportunity to study homologous brain function in a naturalistic way that
  cannot be done with any other species. Dr. Berns will show how dogs can b
 e trained to cooperatively participate in fMRI studies – without restrai
 nt or anesthesia – and how this has opened up a wealth of new data about
  canine brain function. These results have identified the circuitry of pot
 entially homologous functions ranging from reward and face processing to r
 udiments of language perception. And because dogs live with humans\, they 
 offer a unique opportunity to study the neurobiology of inter-species soci
 al cognition. Machine-learning approaches can be used to “decode” the 
 dog brain. Finally\, because the dogs participate in repeated scan session
 s over their lifetimes\, the project has created a unique longitudinal coh
 ort\, which\, in some cases has allowed the detection of CNS tumors before
  symptoms appear and the monitoring of tumor regression following radiatio
 n treatment.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\nDr. Berns is the Distinguished Professor o
 f Neuroeconomics and Psychology at Emory University\, where he directs the
  Facility for Education & Research in Neuroscience. Trained as a biomedica
 l engineer\, he was also a practicing psychiatrist in the Department of Ps
 ychiatry at Emory University and was one of the founding members of the fi
 eld of neuroeconomics\, using fMRI to study mechanisms of decision-making 
 in humans. In 2011\, he launched an effort to train dogs to cooperatively 
 participate in fMRI studies\, resulting in the first demonstration of its 
 feasibility. Since then\, he has trained and scanned 100 dogs on a wide va
 riety of cognitive paradigms.\n\nSchedule of Brown Bag Speakers Fall 2019

 \nProf. Blair Brettmann - School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering\
 , School of Materials Science and Engineering\, Georgia Institute of Techn
 ology\nAbstract: Electrospinning is a valuable production method for nanos
 cale polymeric fibers. However\, a major limitation of the technology is t
 he requirement for the use of high molecular weight polymers as a major pa
 rt of the matrix. Many applications would benefit from a more expansive ra
 nge in the materials able to be electrospun\, including pharmaceuticals\, 
 wearable devices and diagnostics\, and active filtration. In order to real
 ize these more advanced functional materials\, composites of polymers and 
 particles must be developed and a strong understanding of how particle inc
 lusion affects the electrospinning process and mat properties is essential
 . In this work\, we examine material systems containing various polymers a
 nd active particles\, focusing on how inclusion of particles affects elect
 rospinnability and functionality of the fibrous mat. We have found that po
 lymer solutions with high conductivity\, hence narrow fiber diameters\, te
 nd to trap particles in a web-like structure\, rather than within individu
 al fibers. Other polymer-particle systems exhibit a ‘bunches of grapes
 ’ morphology where the particles agglomerate yet the polymer matrix stil
 l surrounds them and connects the bunches with fibers. These interesting m
 orphologies can be explained by conductivity\, rheology\, and particle int
 eractions in the polymer solution. We also examine how particle inclusion 
 affects the viscoelasticity of the solutions and tie this to the electrosp
 inning process window\; showing that a finite window of viscoelasticity yi
 elds optimal electrospinnability. We use these fundamental results to elec
 trospin materials for advanced functional applications such as pharmaceuti
 cals and conducting polymers and provide outlook for further work in incre
 asing the range of materials that are electrospinnable.\n\nBio: Blair Bret
 tmann is an Assistant Professor of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering a

 al Engineering and Materials Science\, Colorado School of Mines\n\nAbstrac
 t\n\nThe Alliance for the Development of Additive Processing Technologies 
 (ADAPT) is developing a combined physics – machine learning platform for
  assessing Process-Structure-Property relationships in metals additive man
 ufacturing. An added benefit of this approach is the inherent statistical 
 core of the models – the AI platform is not only capable of learning the
  PSP relations of AM\, but also providing statistical reports on part qual
 ity and variation in a manner conducive to certification. In this presenta
 tion\, it will be shown how such a framework can be used to optimize parts
 \, processes\, and materials for metals additive manufacturing\, resulting
  in reduced times and costs for qualifications. The parts example will cov
 er accelerated qualification of a 17-4 Stainless Steel door hinge for an A
 rmy ground vehicle. The materials example will document ways and means to 
 make laser powder bed fusion manufactured Inconel 718 stronger & more duct
 ile than wrought material. The processes example will show how machine lea
 rning can be used to determine the parameters for a new printer that has a
  more powerful laser than previous generations of machines\, with verifica
 tion carried out in printing Ti-64 coupons. These examples will be motivat
 ed with a vision for how networks of 3D printers that share a common datab
 ase can shift paradigms in manufacturing.\n\nBiography\n\nAaron is the Row

 egion on Australia’s east coast is home to the world’s largest coal ex
 port operation. More tons of coal are exported each year from the port of 
 Newcastle\, at the mouth of the Hunter River\, than from any other port in
  the world. Coal exported is mined by more than 10 competing producers ope
 rating upward of 40 mines\, but uses shared infrastructure to reach the po
 rt\, be blended into final products held in stockyards and loaded onto ves
 sels at berth. The shared infrastructure\, which consists of rail lines\, 
 trains\, stockyards\, stockpile stacking and reclaiming machinery\, berths
 \, vessel loading machinery\, the river channel and tug boats\, is owned a
 nd/or operated by several different organizations. All of these organizati
 ons must coordinate their activities so as to deliver coal in an effective
  and efficient way. In this talk\, we will discuss how collaboration betwe
 en the many stakeholders has been shaped and evolved\, how collaboration h
 as been essential to the delivery of productivity gains in this complex lo
 gistics system\, and will touch on the critical role analytics and the too
 ls of operations research have played.​\n\nSESSION SPEAKER\n\nNatashia B

 nStatus: published\n\nSpeaker: Dr. Morris B. Cohen\, Associate Professor\,
  School of ECE\n\nTitle: Career directions in ECE\n\nAbstract: It’s an a
 mazing time to be an ECE major. The need for ECE skills has expanded into 
 places where it never existed before\, like the auto industry. The need fo
 r data analytics permeates nearly every industry\, new and traditional. Bu
 t there are a lot of ways to make a contribution in your career\, and thou
 gh you shouldn’t at all feel obligated to define your career now\, the p
 urpose of this talk is to try and make sure you’ve heard of them. I’ll
  give you a brief overview of my career and research meandering but only b
 rief\, and the rest is to talk about where ECEs can and do go.\n\nSpeaker 
 Bio: Morris Cohen received his B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical Engine
 ering from Stanford University in 2003 and 2010\, respectively\, and serve
 d as a research scientist until August 2013. From September 2012 until Aug
 ust 2013\, Dr. Cohen was appointed as AAAS Science and Technology Policy F
 ellow at the National Science Foundation.\n\nIn Fall 2013\, he joined the 
 faculty in the School of ECE. He is a winner of the NSF CAREER Award in 20
 17\, the ONR Young Investigator Award in 2015\, and was chosen for the San
 timay Basu Prize in 2014\, an award given once per 3 years to an under-35 
 scientist by the International Union of Radio Science (URSI).\n\nDr. Cohen
  is interested in the natural electricity of the Earth\, including lightni
 ng\, the electrically charged upper atmosphere\, and the radiation-filled 
 space environment. He uses radio waves at low frequencies measured all aro
 und the world to understand them\, and develops resulting practical applic
 ations. His group also works on novel techniques to generate low frequency
  waves with nonconventional electrically-short antennas. He is an author o
 f more than 60 journal publications. He employs a “flipped classroom” 
 model in some of his courses to make the experience more active and engagi
 ng.\n\nHe enjoys hiking\, cooking\, traveling\, and building pizza ovens.\
 n\nResearch interests:\n\n- Radio wave emissions from lightning\n- Advance
 d signal processing of low frequency radio data\n- Global lightning geoloc

 , Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\nStatus: published\n\nAbstract
 :\n\nWhen we think about technology mediating human interactions with data
 \, we often think about how it improves the practices of people’s usual 
 activities\, from making them more mindful of their daily movements throug
 h step-tracking devices\, to improving capabilities to make informed busin
 ess decisions using data-rich analytics in a digital dashboard. This talk 
 explores how technologies can expand people to look beyond what they usual
 ly do: how can a zoomable interface spark wonder about aquatic insects to 
 engage non-scientists in water quality monitoring\, and how can a touchscr
 een inspire new questions about familiar objects to foster cross-cultural 
 dialogues? I will present multiple projects integrating interactive techno
 logies as mediators of informal\, social learning and argue for the import
 ance of technology’s role in provoking empathy\, curiosity\, and engagem
 ent to drive and expand interest in unfamiliar domains.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\
 nJessica Roberts is an assistant professor in the School of Interactive Co
 mputing at Georgia Tech. She holds a PhD in Learning Sciences from the Uni
 versity of Illinois-Chicago with a concentration in geospatial analysis an

 \nThe topic for the first Deep Startups of the Fall 2019 semester is Music
  Technology featuring Shachar Oren\, previous Peloton executive for music 
 innovation.\n\nShachar Oren is a thought leader in music business and tech
 nology and founder of the company\, Neurotic Media\, which he grew to bein
 g a leading force in music distribution for all the major music labels. In
  2018\, he sold the company to Peloton and served as VP of Music in charge
  of music innovation for a year. Shachar stepped down from Peloton in May 
 and has been advising TechStars and ATDC companies and while also serving 
 as volunteer President of Georgia Music Partners.\n\nDeep Startups is an e
 vent series that features knowledgeable entrepreneurs who discuss their ex
 periences forming companies that solve big-picture current problems. These
  individuals speak to the concept of ‘deep startups’ and how to create
  companies that make a difference. Each Deep Startups event focuses on a d

 e served customers operating in a wide variety of harsh environments—fro
 m deep ocean basins to outer space. Huff began his career working for offs
 hore drilling companies after graduating from Georgia Tech. This experienc
 e\, and his penchant for adventure\, eventually led him to became presiden
 t and CEO of Oceaneering\, which he transformed from a small offshore oil 
 and diving company into a highly successful multinational corporation. Huf
 f achieved this by tying oil exploration with deep sea exploration. In add

 ed vehicles that assisted in the exploration of the Titanic\, the wreckage
  of the Challenger capsule\, and the remains of the H.L. Hunley\, a Civil

 , Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\nStatus: published\n\nAbstract
 :\n\nMorphing matter harnesses the programmability in material structures 
 and compositions to achieve transformative behaviors and integrates sensin
 g\, actuation\, and computation to create adaptive and responsive material
  systems. These material systems can be leveraged to design soft robots\, 
 self-assembling furniture\, adaptive fabrics\, and self-folding foods. In 
 this talk\, Lining presents the recent works in the Morphing Matter Lab\, 
 Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University and hig
 hlights several robotic morphing materials that weave advanced manufacturi
 ng with computational tools. Her team believes that the term “robotics
 ” does not only refer to conventional robotic forms and controls but als
 o connects to the artifacts’ ability to make decisions\, adapt\, move\, 
 and respond to different stimuli. More information from the lab site: http
 s://morphingmatter.cs.cmu.edu/.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\nLining Yao is an Assist
 ant Professor of Human-Computer Interaction Institute (HCII) at Carnegie M
 ellon University\, School of Computer Science\, directing the Morphing Mat
 ter Lab. Morphing Matter lab develops materials\, tools\, and applications
  of adaptive\, dynamic and intelligent morphing matter from nano to macro 
 scales. Research often combines material science\, computational fabricati
 on and creative design practices. Lining and her lab work anti-disciplinar
 ily\, publishing and exhibiting across science\, engineering\, design and 
 art. Lining gained her PhD at MIT Media Lab\, where she combined biologica
 l and engineering approaches to develop physical materials with dynamic an
 d tunable properties including shape\, color\, stiffness\, texture and den
 sity. Beyond her teaching and research in the School of Computer Science\,
  Lining holds courtesy appointments at Mechanical Engineering\, as well as
  Material Sciences and Engineering. She is supervising undergraduate and g
 raduate students across the College of Engineering and College of Art.\n\n

 Abstract: Organic\, hybrid\, and 2D materials have attracted interest for 
 electronic applications due to their potential for use in low-cost\, large
 -area\, flexible electronic devices. Here we will report on recent develop
 ments pertaining to surface modifiers and dopants that could impact the ch
 arge injection/collection/transport processes in organic light emitting di
 odes\, organic field effect transistors\, and photovoltaic devices. In par
 ticular\, we will examine how N-heterocylic carbenes assemble on gold subs
 trates\, the impact of the surface dipole on the work function of the gold
 . We will also discuss the development of metallocenes-based dimers as n-d
 opants and very briefly describe metal dithiolene complexes as p-dopants f
 or organic semiconductors and their impact of device performance.\n\nBio: 
 Seth Marder is currently the Georgia Power Chair of Energy Efficiency and

 :\n\nDigital technologies have increasingly begun to permeate the driving 
 experience in recent years to support continually increasing information a
 nd cognitive needs associated with driving and non-driving activities in t
 he car. With recent pilot projects like Waymo\, Uber\, and Tesla\, we can 
 anticipate that autonomous driving technology will have a significant impa
 ct on accelerating the transformation of automobile interface in its more 
 than one hundred years long history. As the technology matures\, and initi
 al public enthusiasm wanes\, designing a better user experience within thi
 s new mode of travel will be of critical importance for our future. In thi
 s talk\, we examined the user experience issues that will arise with the i
 ntroduction of autonomous driving including the attention-activity changes
  and related design considerations. We then discuss current disciplinary-s
 pecific design methodologies and introduce a more comprehensive approach t
 o the design space to optimize the opportunities for user interaction with
  examples to meet the changes in the vehicle and the associated transporta
 tion service.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\nAs an assistant professor\, Dr. Wei Wang 
 brings industrial and international experience to the Industrial Design pr
 ogram at Georgia Institute of Technology. His research interests stand in 
 the interactive technology\, human-computer interaction and smart product 
 design from user experience perspective. He is directing DesigNext lab in 
 School of Industrial Design on the applications of emerging interface desi
 gn in future consumer electronics. His patents in gesture interaction and 
 mobile service have been applied widely in consumer products by Nokia and 
 Microsoft. Wang won multiply international awards\, included the Annual En
 gagement and Enterprise Awards from Queen Mary University of London (UK)\,
  Annual Achievement Awards from Nokia (Finland)\, the Science and Technolo
 gy Award of China Mechanical Industry (China)\, and the Michelin Challenge
  Design Award in the worldwide. Wang used to work in Nokia Research Center
 \, Hunan University and Queen Mary University of London before he joined G
 eorgia Tech in 2016. Wang is a member of IDSA and ACM SIGCHI\, and receive
 d his Ph.D. in design in 2008.\n\nSchedule of Brown Bag Speakers Fall 2019

 \nTITLE: Edge Computing: A New Disruptive Force\n\nABSTRACT:\n\nAt the hei
 ght of its success\, cloud computing is yielding to edge computing. Why is
  this happening? What is the unique value proposition of edge computing? A
 s real-world deployments of edge computing appear\, how will the lives of 
 end users be improved? What new applications and capabilities will they se
 e? Which applications run best at the edge\, which run best in the cloud\,
  and which should straddle the edge and cloud? How do we build systems tha
 t are seamless to the user but leverage all the available tiers of computi
 ng to best effect? Based on my team’s decade-long exploration of edge co
 mputing\, I will share my insights on these questions. Of particular inter
 est is a new class of “wearable cognitive assistance” applications tha
 t lie at the convergence of edge computing\, wearable devices\, and cognit
 ive algorithms (e.g. computer vision\, speech recognition\, natural langua
 ge processing). Drawing upon insights from these edge-native applications\
 , I will explore what hardware and software infrastructure is needed for e
 dge computing.\n\nBIO:\n\nSatya’s multi-decade research career has focus
 ed on the challenges of performance\, scalability\, availability\, and tru
 st in information systems that reach from the cloud to the mobile edge of 
 the internet. In the course of this work\, he has pioneered many advances 
 in distributed systems\, mobile computing\, pervasive computing\, and the 
 internet of things (IoT). As described in How we created edge computing\, 
 Satya’s seminal 2009 publication The Case for VM-based Cloudlets in Mobi
 le Computing\, and the ensuing research has led to the emergence of edge c
 omputing (also known as fog computing). Satya is the Carnegie Group Profes
 sor of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. He received his Ph.
 D. in computer science from Carnegie Mellon after bachelor’s and master
 ’s degrees from the Indian Institute of Technology\, Madras. He is a Fel
 low of the ACM and the IEEE. For a more detailed bio\, see Satya’s Wikip
 edia entry.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.edu/node/625978#0

  in the workshop\, you will learn the following:\n\n• An introduction to
  the concept of implicit bias and how these unconscious\, automatic mental
  processes may impact behaviors such as evaluating candidates during facul
 ty search and/or RPT processes.\n\n• Empirical research on vitaes\, lett
 ers of recommendations\, and teaching evaluations to illustrate the impact
  of implicit bias on decisions.\n\n• Effective practices and strategies 
 for faculty search and RPT committees.\n\nThese workshops will be facilita

 ree food\nStatus: published\n\nABSTRACT\n\nIn a crystal with only one atom
  per unit cell\, all atoms play the same role in producing the solid's glo
 bal response to external perturbations. Disordered materials are not simil
 arly constrained and a new principle emerges: independence of bond-level r
 esponse. This allows one to drive the system to different regimes of behav
 ior by successively removing individual bonds. We can thus exploit disorde
 r to achieve unique\, varied\, textured and tunable global response or lon
 g-range interactions inspired by allosteric behavior in proteins. While th
 is approach is successful for systems with only a few degrees of freedom\,
  it is difficult to scale up the number of elements to be controlled or sc
 ale down the size of the individual components. However\, because a materi
 al has a memory of under what conditions it has been aged\, we can direct 
 the aging using Nature’s greedy algorithms to achieve a variety of mecha
 nical functionalities.\n\nABOUT THE SPEAKER\n\nSidney Nagel is the Stein-F

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Postdoc
 \, Public\, Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\, Freebies\nStatus: 
 published\n\nA Frontiers in Science Lecture to celebrate 2019\, the Intern
 ational Year of the Periodic Table\nThe Cold War rivalry between the Unite
 d States and the Soviet Union lasted for much of the second half of the 20
 th century. While the superpowers never engaged directly in full-scale arm
 ed combat\, a nuclear arms race became the centerpiece of a doctrine of mu
 tually assured destruction\, and prompted a mass production of plutonium\,
  and the designing\, building\, and testing of large numbers of nuclear we
 apons.\n\nIn more than 50 years of operation\, the Cold War battlefields c
 reated over 100 metric tons of plutonium\, produced tens of thousands of n
 uclear warheads\, oversaw more than 1000 detonations\, and left behind a l
 egacy of contaminated facilities\, soils\, and ground water.\n\nThe extent
  of long-term adverse health effects will depend on the mobility of pluton
 ium and other actinides in the environment and on our ability to develop c
 ost-effective scientific methods of removing or isolating actinides from t
 he environment. Studying the complex chemistry of plutonium and the actini
 des in the environment is one of the most important technological challeng
 es\, and one of the greatest scientific challenges in actinide science tod
 ay.\n\nDavid L. Clark will summarize our current understanding of actinide
  chemistry in the environment\, and how that understanding was used in the
  decontamination and decommissioning of the Rocky Flats Site\, where pluto
 nium triggers for U.S. nuclear weapons were manufactured. At Rocky Flats\,
  synchrotron radiation measurements made at the Stanford Synchrotron Radia
 tion Laboratory were developed into a science-based decision-making tool t
 hat saved billions of dollars by focusing site-directed efforts in the cor
 rect areas\, and aided the most extensive cleanup in the history of Superf
 und legislation to finish one year ahead of schedule\, ultimately resultin
 g in billions of dollars in taxpayer savings. (LA-UR-15-22406)\n\nAbout th
 e Speaker\n\nDavid L. Clark [1] is a Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL)
  Fellow and Director of the Laboratory’s National Security Education Cen
 ter. He received a B.S. in chemistry in 1982 from the University of Washin
 gton\, and a Ph.D. in 1986 from Indiana University.\n\nClark was a postdoc
 toral fellow at the University of Oxford before joining Los Alamos Nationa
 l Laboratory as a J. Robert Oppenheimer Fellow in 1988. He became a Techni
 cal Staff Member in the Isotope and Nuclear Chemistry Division in 1989. Si
 nce then he has held various leadership positions at Los Alamos\, includin
 g PI for the Laboratory’s BES Heavy Element Chemistry program (1993 – 
 2014)\, Solubility Task for the Yucca Mountain Project (1993-1997)\, Sourc
 e Term Test Program for the WIPP license application (1996-1997)\, program
  manager for plutonium aging and pit lifetime assessments\, (1998-2003)\, 
 and Capture Manager for the Plutonium Science and Research Strategy (2009 
 – 2019).\n\nClark has been highly involved in service to the actinide ch
 emistry community through organization of ACS symposia (1993-present)\, se
 rvice on organizing and steering committees of 3 international actinide co
 nferences including Actinides (1993-present)\, Migration (2003 – present
 )\, and Plutonium Futures – the Science (1997-present)\; the establishme
 nt and stewardship of the Seaborg Institute at Los Alamos (1997-2009)\; th
 e development of the Plutonium Science and Research Strategy (2009-present
 )\; and much more.\n\nHe has served the DOE as a technical advisor for env
 ironmental stewardship including the Rocky Flats cleanup and closure (1995
 -2005)\, closure of High-Level Waste tanks at the Savannah River Site (201
 1)\, and as a technical advisor to the DOE High Level Waste Corporate Boar
 d (2009-2011).\n\nHe is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advan
 cement of Science\, and a Los Alamos Laboratory Fellow. He is the recipien
 t of two ACS national awards - the Nobel Laureate Signature Award (1988) a
 nd the Glenn Seaborg Award in Nuclear Chemistry (2017). He has also been h
 onored with several Defense Programs Awards of Excellence\, the most notab
 le in 2006 for his work on pit lifetime assessments for the nation.\n\nHis
  research interests are in the molecular and electronic structure of actin
 ide materials\, applications of synchrotron radiation to nuclear security\
 , behavior of actinide and fission products in the environment\, the aging
  effects of nuclear weapons materials\, and the education of judges on the
  methods of science.\n\nHe is an international authority on the chemistry 
 and physics of the actinides\, and has published over 175 peer-reviewed pu
 blications\, encyclopedia and book chapters.\n\nAbout Frontiers in Science

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Postdoc
 \nExtras: Free food\nStatus: published\n\nHow do your grading practices im
 pact your students? Research shows that not all grading practices motivate
  student learning. In fact\, some practices have the opposite effect. For 
 example\, grade curving: did you know grade curving demotivates students? 
 Goergia Tech students have said that grade curving promotes stress\, cheat
 ing\, competition\, and even apathy Students feel there is little room to 
 ever fail and that if they do\, their grade is unlikely to recover. Additi
 onally\, feedback regarding the curve does not come in early enough for st
 udents to determine whether or not they should drop the class.\n\nWhile cu
 rving is a common problematic grading practice\, it isn’t the only one. 
 However\, equitable grading practices that are mathematically accurate\, r
 esistant to bias\, and motivating to students to achieve academic growth a
 nd success can refocus students on learning\, not just the grade. Many ins
 tructors wish to apply these principles in their teaching\, but it can be 
 difficult to determine how to do so\, leaving faculty to wonder how to be 
 both fair and rigorous when grading.\n\nThese topics will be further explo
 red in the Center for Teaching and Learning workshop\, Grading: Are Both E
 quity and Rigor Possible? Participants will ponder common grading approach
 es through the lens of equity to identify opportunities to restore some co
 mpassion to the grading process while still using grades to accurately ref
 lect student learning. The primary goals of the workshop are to help instr
 uctors to consider why they use their grading style compared to available 
 alternatives\, understand grades in the context of how they affect the mot
 ivation\, learning\, and well-being of their students\, and develop an awa
 reness of equitable versus non-equitable grading strategies.\n\nJoin us [1

  as a team of professionals who leverage technologies and processes to def
 end an organization’s systems and networks from attack. However\, this n
 arrow use of security sells the field short – there are in fact a number
  of key functions under the security umbrella\, one of which is cybersecur
 ity\, all of which are essential to the success of the organization. Some 
 such functions are: physical security\, fraud prevention\, privacy\, busin
 ess continuity\, disaster recovery\, and risk management\, although there 
 are still more. And though the security field is defined by the technical 
 “hacker” persona\, people with backgrounds\, skills\, and interests of
  a wide variety have all found success under the umbrella of work in the s

SUMMARY:GVU Center Brown Bag: Yanni Loukissas "All Data Are Local: Thinkin
 g Critically in a Data-Driven Society"

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Public\
 , Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\nStatus: published\n\nAbstract
 :\n\nIn our data-driven society\, it is too easy to assume the transparenc
 y of data. Instead\, Yanni Loukissas argues in All Data Are Local\, we sho
 uld approach data sets with an awareness that data are created by humans a
 nd their dutiful machines\, at a time\, in a place\, with the instruments 
 at hand\, for audiences that are conditioned to receive them. The term dat
 a set implies something discrete\, complete\, and portable\, but it is non
 e of those things. Examining a series of data sources important for unders
 tanding the state of public life in the United States—Harvard's Arnold A
 rboretum\, the Digital Public Library of America\, UCLA's Television News 
 Archive\, and the real estate marketplace Zillow—Loukissas shows us how 
 to analyze data settings rather than data sets.\n\nLoukissas sets out six 
 principles: all data are local\; data have complex attachments to place\; 
 data are collected from heterogeneous sources\; data and algorithms are in
 extricably entangled\; interfaces recontextualize data\; and data are inde
 xes to local knowledge. He then provides a set of practical guidelines to 
 follow. To make his argument\, Loukissas employs a combination of qualitat
 ive research on data cultures and exploratory data visualizations. Rebutti
 ng the “myth of digital universalism\,” Loukissas reminds us of the me
 aning-making power of the local.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\nYanni Alexander Loukis
 sas is an Assistant Professor of Digital Media in the School of Literature
 \, Media\, and Communication at Georgia Tech\, where he directs the Local 
 Data Design Lab. His research is focused on helping creative people think 
 critically about the social implications of emerging technologies. His new
  monograph from MIT Press\, All Data Are Local: Thinking Critically in a D
 ata-Driven Society\, is addressed to a growing audience of practitioners w
 ho want to work with unfamiliar data both effectively and ethically. Origi
 nally trained as an architect at Cornell\, he subsequently attended MIT\, 
 where he received a Master of Science and a PhD in Design and Computation 
 and completed postdoctoral work at the Program in Science\, Technology and
  Society.\n\nSchedule of Brown Bag Speakers Fall 2019 [1]\n\nLinks:\n[0]

 ing\nProfessor\, Materials Science and Engineering\nArthur F. Thurnau Prof
 essor\, Mechanical Engineering\nJanine Johnson Weins Professor\n\nThe firs
 t concept that will be explored in this talk is the time-dependent nature 
 of cracking in polymeric coatings\, with a particular interest in the coat
 ings for automotive polymeric glazing. Experiments suggest that crack velo
 cities in these particular systems\, while sensitive to visco-elastic prop
 erties\, are controlled by kinetic processes.\nThe second topic will addre
 ss the adhesion of ice to polymeric coatings. In particular\, the work ill
 ustrates the dual role that both interfacial strength and interfacial toug
 hness play in determining the conditions for delamination. Experimental st
 udies show that the force required to delaminate a layer of ice from a pol
 ymeric coating depends on the scale of the problem.\n\n“Collecting Long-

 etit Distinguished Lecture by Wendell Lim\, University of California\, San
  Francisco\n\nThe eras of molecular biology and genomics have given us an 
 unprecedented picture of the molecular components underlying living system
 s. Nonetheless\, our understanding of how these components are assembled t
 o generate precision physiological systems remains far less developed.\n\n
 To approach this problem\, we and others have been using synthetic biology
  methods to empirically explore how molecular components can be used to co
 nstruct novel cellular functions. Using these approaches\, we have shown t
 hat we can reprogram living cellular machines that carry out new precision
  functions\, including therapeutic immune cells that precisely recognize a
 nd eliminate cancer cells\, or cells that self-organize into tissues.\n\nB
 y merging our understanding of cellular machines with our knowledge of our
  bodies and its diseases\, we envision the development of a mature field o
 f cell engineering with a toolbox of optimized molecular parts and circuit
  architectures\, as well as disease and "GPS" sensors that allow the cell 
 to target specific sites in the body or brain.\n\nSuch a platform will all
 ow us to rapidly and flexibly prototype and design cells that can identify
  sites of disease or degeneration and execute precisely targeted and contr
 olled therapeutic actions.\n\nAbout the Speaker\nWendell Lim is the Byers 
 Distinguished Professor and Chair of the Department of Cellular and Molecu

 ocuses on the design principles of molecular circuits that govern cell dec
 ision-making and responses. His lab has made contributions in understandin
 g the molecular machinery of cell signaling and how molecular modules have
  been used in evolution to build novel new behaviors.\n\nMost recently he 
 has been a pioneer in the emerging field of synthetic biology\, exploring 
 how these design principles can be harnessed to engineer cells with custom

 \nProf. John Rogers - Depts. of Materials Science and Engineering\, Biomed
 ical Engineering and Medicine\; Northwestern University\nAbstract: A remar
 kable feature of modern integrated circuit technology is its ability to op
 erate in a stable fashion\, with almost perfect reliability\, without phys
 ical or chemical change. Recently developed classes of electronic material
 s create an opportunity to engineer the opposite outcome\, in the form of 
 ‘transient’ devices that dissolve\, disintegrate or otherwise disappea
 r at triggered times or with controlled rates. Water-soluble transient ele
 ctronics serve as the foundations for interesting applications in zero-imp
 act environmental monitors\, 'green' consumer electronics and bio-resorbab
 le biomedical implants. This presentation describes the foundational conce
 pts in chemistry\, materials science and assembly processes for bioresorba
 ble electronics in 1D\, 2D and 3D architectures. Wireless sensors of intra
 cranial temperature\, pressure and electrophysiology designed for use in t
 reatment of traumatic brain injury and nerve stimulators configured for ac
 celerated neuroregeneration provide application examples.\n\nBio: John A. 
 Rogers is the Louis Simpson and Kimberly Querrey Professor of Materials Sc
 ience and Engineering\, Biomedical Engineering and Medicine at Northwester
 n University\, with affiliate appointments in Mechanical Engineering\, Ele
 ctrical and Computer Engineering and Chemistry\, where he is also Director
  of the newly endowed Center for Bio-Integrated Electronics. He has publis
 hed more than 650 papers\, is a co-inventor on more than 100 patents and h

 \nLecture Topic | Planning Sustainably: An Infrastructure-based Approach\n
 \nThe lecture will address the sustainability of infrastructure and the En
 vision® rating system\, developed at Harvard University. Then\, sustainab
 le infrastructure will be introduced as the starting point and a prerequis
 ite for sustainable cities and an inextricable part of urban planning and 
 configuration. The proposed systems approach emphasizes the synergies and 
 interconnections between infrastructure processes\, including physical str
 uctures and operations\, natural processes\, and the end-user. Each system
  is decoded\, addressing (a) the main demand or consumption that must be c
 overed by the system\, (b) the strategic approach and resources to meet th
 e demand\, and (c) the facilities and networks required. When a system is 
 relevant to the needs or performance of another system\, the connection is
  highlighted supporting the development of multifaceted\, integrated plans

SUMMARY:GVU Center Brown Bag: Krystina Madej "Disney Animation: Story and 
 Technology"

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Public\
 , Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\nStatus: review\n\nAbstract:\n
 \nWalt Disney is described variously as an American entrepreneur\, a film 
 producer\, a pioneer of the American animation industry\, the founder of t
 he theme park industry. Public perception of him is of a filmmaker with an
  uncanny ability to create entertaining family oriented animated films and
  experiences. More than that Walt Disney was a visionary who believed tech
 nology should be pushed to its limits to realize stories\, provide experie
 nces\, and build worlds. That a technology did not exist or was not yet re
 ady to solve a problem was not an obstacle – his answer was always – b
 uild it.\n\nDisney Stories: Getting to Digital (Lee & Madej\, 2012) discus
 ses how Walt Disney and then the Walt Disney Company narratives evolved fr
 om traditional animation to computer games and online narrative experience
 s. In the upcoming second edition (January 2020) I look at technology as i
 t has been used to enhance story from the first feature animation Snow Whi
 te and the Seven Dwarfs to the first VR short Cycles. This talk first prov
 ides an overview of the technological innovation that has driven the many 
 arms of the Disney empire\, most recently the animatronics for the new Sta
 r Wars worlds at Walt Disney World and Disneyland. This is followed by a p
 resentation of Disney advances in technology made in the genre of animated
  films from the 1940s to today as Disney moved from the traditional method
 s of integrating animation and live action in Song of the South and later 
 Mary Poppins\, to CGI assisted films beginning with Tron\, through many it
 erations to Big Hero Six\, and finally to VR and its use in shorts such as
  Styles.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\nKrystina Madej is Professor of Practice at Geo
 rgia Tech\, Atlanta\, where she has taught since 2011. Her research intere
 sts are play and games\, interactivity and collaboration in social media\,
  material culture of media\, and narrative across media. In particular she
  looks at children’s traditional and digital games\, play and narratives
  in social media and Disney’s approach to narrative and technology. Her 
 research has resulted in a number of books including Physical Play and Chi
 ldren’s Digital Games (2016)\, Interactivity\, Collaboration\, and Autho
 ring in Social Media (2015)\, and Disney Stories: Getting to Digital (2012
 ). She has been visiting professor and taught courses in Narrative at the 
 Center for Digital Media in Vancouver\, Canada\, and in Children’s Games
 \, Disney Animation\, and Design Thinking at the University of Lower Siles
 ia in Wroclaw\, Poland (both for the Erasmus program and the Masters in Bi
 g Data\, Digital Media\, and Trendwatching ). Dr. Madej’s first interest
  was in Fine Arts: she received her BFA from Concordia University in Montr
 eal\, Canada. She went on to a career as a design strategist and partnered
  with a colleague to start the first Industrial Design and Communications 
 business in western Canada that used computer technologies for the design 
 and production of products\, graphics\, and exhibits. She later returned t
 o academia and completed her doctoral studies in Digital Narrative at the 
 School of Interactive Art and Technology\, SFU\, Vancouver\, Canada.\n\nSc

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Postdoc
 \, Public\, Undergraduate students\nStatus: published\n\nIn 2016\, Georgia
  Tech collected preliminary data through an online survey of 771 students.
  The report found that 10% of Georgia Tech’s students responded being in
  need of food assistance and that 16% prioritized working at their job ove
 r academics and extracurricular activities. Georgia Tech’s actions to fi
 ll this gap include opening Klemis Kitchen in 2015\, an on-campus food pan
 try that provides leftover food from the dining halls and Panera Bread as 
 well as canned donations from other sources. However\, in Spring 2019\, on
 ly 100 students have self-identified and enrolled in the program\; a far c
 ry from the 10% of students estimated in the 2016 survey.\n\nTo ensure bot
 h the highest levels of health and academic performance of all GT students
 \, we need to understand the effects of food insecurity/security on health
  and academic performance\, identify effective methods of recognizing stud
 ents who are food insecure\, and develop interventions to that will increa
 se food security among those students who are food insecure. The purpose o
 f this preliminary study is to address the first two issues. Our specific 
 aims are 1) to understand the impact of food security/insecurity on academ
 ic performance and 2) identify passive tools that can predict profiles of 
 food insecure students that are specific to students within a semester per
 iod.\n\nModerators:\n\nJon Sanford\, Professor\, School of Industrial Desi

  Science Chalmers University of Technology\, Göteborg\, Sweden\n\nAbstrac
 t\n\nHigh performance polymer matrix composites (PMC) have a high specific
  stiffness and can be used to easily manufacture highly complex components
 . Hierarchical composite materials with microstructures designed for speci
 fic multifunctional purposes are an important development area for modern 
 materials. The demand for new materials is increasing and the rate at whic
 h those new materials should complete the development cycle is decreasing.
  In order to meet this demand\, existing material development frameworks m
 ust be enhanced via more progressive human-computer materials development.
  A few techniques are presented to meet this need including: a combination
  of modern imaging techniques and finite element analysis of in-situ fiber
  bundles\, a stochastic approach utilizing experimental through-thickness 
 scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of nanocomposites to create virt
 ual representations of the experimental microstructure\, an adaptation of 
 hierarchical materials developed in nature\, and the potential for a low e
 nergy\, high performance processing methods.\n\nBiography\n\nDr. Brina Bli
 nzler is an Assistant Professor in Composite Mechanics at Chalmers Univers
 ity of Technology. Her research focuses on composite process modeling\, me
 chanics\, and material informatics. She leads the all Wood Composites Plat
 form and is a representative for the Chalmers Graphene Center in the Focus
  Area: Multifunctional Composites and Coatings. She has recently received 
 the Jacob Wallenbergs Foundation: Material Science Research Award (2019) a
 nd the Hasselblad Foundation: Female Scientist Award (2018). Previously\, 
 Dr. Blinzler conducted research at Scaled Composites\, Easton Baseball/ So
 ftball and other companies. In addition\, she was a recipient of the NASA 
 Graduate Student Researchers Program fellowship\, holds a PhD in Civil Eng
 ineering from the University of Akron and BS in Civil Engineering from Mis

 obility (CURAM)\n\nPizza Provided\nOver the past two years\, the term "urb
 an air mobility (UAM)" has entered the vernacular of the aerospace industr
 y. Silicon Valley unicorns\, individual billionaires\, startup companies\,
  automotive firms\, and traditional aerospace manufacturers worldwide are 
 investing in the development of over 200 electric vertical takeoff and lan
 ding (eVTOL) aircraft to serve the UAM market. Often called "flying cars" 
 or "air taxis\," these aircraft designs are novel\, incorporating many new
  technologies. We are entering only the early days of UAM\, an era of grea
 t uncertainty. No one understands whether and how the market will emerge. 
 No one understands how eVTOL aircraft will be certified. No one understand
 s how to manage the airspace in cities when filled with air taxis. No one 
 understands how cities will regulate "vertiports" where aircraft will land
  to embark and disembark passengers. No one understands which aircraft des
 igns will "win" and how the best design varies city to city. In this era o
 f uncertainty\, there is great opportunity\, and there is great risk. This
  talk will provide an introduction to the current landscape of urban air m
 obility\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.edu/node/628104#0

 \nLook around at some of the familiar objects and materials in your surrou
 ndings. These things can be transformed. By combining everyday materials w
 ith computing\, we can extend and reimagine their expressive and functiona
 l possibilities. We can also invite people to explore a new design space t
 hrough making. In this talk\, HyunJoo will present her recent work in inte
 grating paper and recycled materials with computing and discuss a suite of
  computational design tools her research team has developed. She will desc
 ribe how combinations of everyday materials with computation can expand cr
 eative possibilities while leveraging familiarity to empower designers and
  learners.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\nHyunJoo Oh is an assistant professor with a 
 joint appointment in the School of Industrial Design and the School of Int
 eractive Computing at Georgia Tech. Working at the intersection of Human-C
 omputer Interaction and Design\, she develops computational design tools t
 hat integrate everyday materials with computing. Her work investigates fun
 damental questions on how people see and think\, and make\, in particular 
 how those are closely linked and shape each other. Her work has been publi
 shed and exhibited at ACM SIGCHI conferences such as CHI\, TEI\, and DIS\,
  and featured in venues including CNET and Maker Ed.\n\nSchedule of Brown

 \, Public\, Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\, Freebies\nStatus: 
 published\n\nA Frontiers in Science Lecture to celebrate 2019\, the Intern
 ational Year of the Periodic Table\nIn 1997\, the Japanese oceanographer Y
 oshiyuki Nozaki compiled a periodic table of ocean chemistry\, encapsulati
 ng the distribution of elements as a function of depth. In this periodic t
 able\, many elements share similar patterns\, classified into just a few c
 ategories. The similarities indicate a common set of mechanisms behind the
  ocean cycling of elements.\n\nThe interaction of ocean circulation\, chem
 istry\, and biology sets the distribution of elements in the ocean. For ex
 ample\, nonreactive elements are nearly uniformly distributed in the water
  column\, homogenized by ocean circulation and mixing.\n\nNutrient element
 s are depleted near the surface because of biological consumption and enri
 ched in mid-depth due to decomposition of organic matter. Some trace metal
 s – such as Fe\, Zn\, Ni\, and Cd – follow this pattern. In contrast\,
  some heavy metals – like Al\, Mn\, Co\, and Pb – are subsumed into pa
 rticles and removed from seawater.\n\nBuilding on the insights from Nozaki
 ’s periodic table\, this talk will interpret recent measurements of chan
 ging seawater chemistry\, highlighting the importance of rising carbon dio
 xide concentration in the air\, climate change\, and pollution of rivers a
 nd atmosphere.\n\nAbout the Speaker\nTakamitsu “Taka” Ito [1] is an as
 sociate professor in the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences\, where 
 he teaches physical and chemical oceanography. He received a Ph.D. in Eart
 h\, Atmospheric\, and Planetary Sciences in 2005 from Massachusetts Instit
 ute of Technology. His research has focused on the cycling of carbon\, oxy
 gen\, and iron in the global oceans\, using observations\, theory\, and co
 mputational modeling.\n\nAbout Frontiers in Science Lectures\nLectures in 
 this series are intended to inform\, engage\, and inspire students\, facul
 ty\, staff\, and the public on developments\, breakthroughs\, and topics o
 f general interest in the sciences and mathematics. Lecturers tailor their
  talks for nonexpert audiences.\n\nAbout the Periodic Table Frontiers in S

 \nThe College of Sciences\; the School of Literature\, Media\, and Communi
 cation\; and the Georgia Tech Library invite all to a conversation among s
 cience fiction authors and scientists\, as part of Georgia Tech's celebrat
 ion of the International Year of the Periodic Table (IYPT).\n\nIYPT has br
 ought well-deserved attention to the periodic table and the chemical eleme
 nts. As the world celebrates the 150th anniversary of the periodic table\,
  chemical elements have never been so central to the global imagination. J
 ust look at recent blockbuster films revolving around vibranium and infini
 ty stones.\n\nBut did chemical elements really ever go out of style?\n\nMo
 derated by Charlie Bennett [01]\, this panel discussion brings two scienti
 sts and two science fiction writers together to explore how science and ar
 t have long influenced each other while shaping public understanding of th
 e periodic table and chemical elements and their role in our everyday live
 s.\n\nGeorgia Tech scientists Deirdre Shoemaker [02] and M.G. Finn [03] wi
 ll have a conversation with Milton J. Davis [04]\, science fiction writer 
 and chemist\, and Amanda Weiss [05]\, an up-and-coming science fiction aut
 hor who teaches Japanese at Georgia Tech. Through their conversation\, we 
 hope to get a closer look at how new — and sometimes very old! — ideas
  about how the world works circulate through science\, fiction\, and cultu
 re at large.\n\nAbout the Discussants\nCharlie Bennett [01] is the public 
 engagement librarian and economics specialist at Georgia Tech. He holds a 
 Master’s in Library and Information Science from Valdosta State Universi
 ty\, and a B.S. in Economics and in Science\, Technology\, and Culture fro
 m Georgia Tech. His research interests include the role of the library in 
 civic life and scholarly communication to the general public. Bennett prod
 uces and co-hosts the rock’n’roll library show " Lost in the Stacks [0
 6] " and the talk show " The North Avenue Lounge [07]\, " both on WREK Atl
 anta\, as well as the media podcast " Supercontext [08]. " The first scien
 ce fiction he can remember reading is the Tripods trilogy by John Christop
 her\, and he’s been fascinated by the genre ever since.\n\nMilton J. Dav
 is [09] is a black speculative fiction writer. He is the author of 17 nove
 ls and editor or co-editor of seven anthologies. He owns MVmedia\, LLC\, a
  small publishing company specializing in science fiction\, fantasy\, and 
 "Sword and Soul." Davies is also the technical director of Hill Manufactur
 ing\, a company specializing in maintenance chemicals and products. As a r
 esearch chemist\, he has developed polymers for the textile\, janitorial\,
  and computer industries. In 2004\, he received a U.S. patent for a cleani
 ng solvent and dispenser pen designed to remove conformal coatings and adh
 esives from circuit boards and other electrical equipment.\n\nM.G. Finn [1
 0] is a professor and chair of Georgia Tech’s School of Chemistry and Bi
 ochemistry\, a faculty member in the School of Biological Sciences\, and t
 he James A. Carlos Family Chair for Pediatric Technology. In his research\
 , his laboratory develops new vaccines\, ways to find and kill cancer cell
 s\, new materials for drug delivery and membrane-based separations\, and w
 ays to evolve molecules with desired functions. He is the editor-in-chief 
 of the journal ACS Combinatorial Science. His science fiction inspirations
  are decidedly old-school\, ranging from Ray Bradbury to Ursula K. Le Guin
  to Dan Simmons.\n\nDeirdre Shoemaker [02] is the Dunn Family Professor of
  Physics in Georgia Tech’s School of Physics. She is the director of the
  Georgia Tech Center for Relativistic Astrophysics and associate director 
 of the Institute for Data Engineering and Sciences. Black holes\, spacetim
 e wrinkles and gravitational waves — understanding these and other aspec
 ts of gravity drives Shoemaker’s research. She is a member of the Astron
 omy and Astrophysics Advisory Council and the NASA LISA Study Team. She is
  also a member of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration\, which detected gravi
 tational waves for the first time on September 14 2015\, ushering in the e
 ra of gravitational wave astronomy. The strange and wondrous predictions o
 f Einstein’s theory are playing out in the universe\, and Shoemaker is w
 atching.\n\nAmanda Weiss [05] is an assistant professor of Japanese in the
  Georgia Tech School of Modern Languages. Prior to her work at Georgia Tec
 h\, she taught courses on East Asian media and society at Earlham College\
 , Emory University\, and Rikkyo University in Tokyo. She is completing her
  first book\, "Han Heroes and Yamato Warriors: Competing Masculinities in 
 East Asian War Cinema\," based on her doctoral research in the University 
 of Tokyo. She has started a second project\, on the contemporary Japanese 
 remembrance of Manchukuo\, the puppet state of the Empire of Japan from 19
 32 until 1945.\n\nLinks:\n[00]  http://hg.gatech.edu/node/627532#0\n[01]

 ch students\, faculty\, and staff\n\nThe exhibit will formally open with r
 emarks from Susan Lozier\, Dean of the College of Sciences\; TBD from Ivan
  Allen College of Liberal Arts\; and Ameet Doshi\, Library Director of Ser
 vice Experience and Program Design\n\nImmediately following the opening re
 marks is a panel discussion: From Myth to Marvel: The Role of Elements in 
 Science\, Fiction\, and Culture\n\nThe International Year of the Periodic 
 Table has brought well-deserved attention to the periodic table and the ch
 emical elements. As the world celebrates 2019 the 150th anniversary of the
  periodic table\, chemical elements have never been so central to the glob
 al imagination. Just look at recent blockbuster films revolving around vib
 ranium and infinity stones.\n\nBut did chemical elements really ever go ou
 t of style?\n\nModerated by Georgia Tech librarian and North Avenue Lounge
  radio host Charlie Bennett [01]\, this panel discussion brings two scient
 ists and two science fiction authors together to explore how science and a
 rt have long influenced one other while shaping public understanding of th
 e periodic table and chemical elements and their role in our everyday live
 s.\n\nGeorgia Tech physicist Deirdre Shoemaker [02] and chemist M.G. Finn 
 [03] will have a conversation with Milton Davis [04]\, chemist and award-w
 inning author of nineteen novels and editor of nine anthologies\, and Aman
 da Weiss [05]\, an up-and-coming science fiction and fantasy author who te
 aches Japanese at Georgia Tech. Through their conversation\, we hope to ge
 t a closer look at how new — and sometimes very old! — ideas about how
  the world works circulate through science\, fiction\, and culture at larg
 e.\n\nAbout the Discussants\n\nCharlie Bennett [01] is the public engageme
 nt librarian and economics specialist at Georgia Tech. He holds a Master
 ’s in Library and Information Science from Valdosta State University\, a
 nd a B.S. in Economics and in Science\, Technology\, and Culture from Geor
 gia Tech. His research interests include the role of the library in civic 
 life and scholarly communication to the general public. Bennett produces a
 nd co-hosts the rock’n’roll library show " Lost in the Stacks [06] " a
 nd the talk show " The North Avenue Lounge [07]\, " both on WREK Atlanta\,
  as well as the media podcast " Supercontext [08]. " The first science fic
 tion he can remember reading is the Tripods trilogy by John Christopher\, 
 and he’s been fascinated by the genre ever since.\n\nMilton J. Davis [09
 ] is a black speculative fiction writer. He is the author of 17 novels and
  editor or co-editor of seven anthologies. He owns MVmedia\, LLC\, a small
  publishing company specializing in science fiction\, fantasy\, and "Sword
  and Soul." Davies is also the technical director of Hill Manufacturing\, 
 a company specializing in maintenance chemicals and products. As a researc
 h chemist\, he has developed polymers for the textile\, janitorial\, and c
 omputer industries. In 2004\, he received a U.S. patent for a cleaning sol
 vent and dispenser pen designed to remove conformal coatings and adhesives
  from circuit boards and other electrical equipment.\n\nM.G. Finn [10] is 
 a professor and chair of Georgia Tech’s School of Chemistry and Biochemi
 stry\, a faculty member in the School of Biological Sciences\, and the Jam
 es A. Carlos Family Chair for Pediatric Technology. In his research\, his 
 laboratory develops new vaccines\, ways to find and kill cancer cells\, ne
 w materials for drug delivery and membrane-based separations\, and ways to
  evolve molecules with desired functions. He is the editor-in-chief of the
  journal ACS Combinatorial Science. His science fiction inspirations are d
 ecidedly old-school\, ranging from Ray Bradbury to Ursula K. Le Guin to Da
 n Simmons.\n\nDeirdre Shoemaker [02] is the Dunn Family Professor of Physi
 cs in Georgia Tech’s School of Physics. She is the director of the Georg
 ia Tech Center for Relativistic Astrophysics and associate director of the
  Institute for Data Engineering and Sciences. Black holes\, spacetime wrin
 kles and gravitational waves — understanding these and other aspects of 
 gravity drives Shoemaker’s research. She is a member of the Astronomy an
 d Astrophysics Advisory Council and the NASA LISA Study Team. She is also 
 a member of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration\, which detected gravitation
 al waves for the first time on September 14 2015\, ushering in the era of 
 gravitational wave astronomy. The strange and wondrous predictions of Eins
 tein’s theory are playing out in the universe\, and Shoemaker is watchin
 g.\n\nAmanda Weiss [05] is an assistant professor of Japanese in the Georg
 ia Tech School of Modern Languages. Prior to her work at Georgia Tech\, sh
 e taught courses on East Asian media and society at Earlham College\, Emor
 y University\, and Rikkyo University in Tokyo. She is completing her first
  book\, "Han Heroes and Yamato Warriors: Competing Masculinities in East A
 sian War Cinema\," based on her doctoral research in the University of Tok
 yo. She has started a second project\, on the contemporary Japanese rememb
 rance of Manchukuo\, the puppet state of the Empire of Japan from 1932 unt
 il 1945.\n\nLinks:\n[00]  http://hg.gatech.edu/node/627520#0\n[01]  https:

 \nTITLE: Software Testing: And the Challenges (and Opportunities) Keep Com
 ing!\n\nABSTRACT:\n\nDisruptive shifts in software application types and s
 oftware development environments create challenges to software testing tha
 t need to be addressed to ensure software quality and reduce the cost of s
 oftware development time. Over the years\, the size and complexity of soft
 ware have grown as well as the need for fast-changing codebases\, fault de
 tection strategies\, and test case generation and selection. To meet these
  challenges\, techniques such as regression testing\, selection/prioritiza
 tion\, and fault localization have been developed as well as specialized t
 esting techniques for GUIs\, object-oriented software\, mobile computing\,
  and continuous evolution of software to name a few. This talk presents an
  overview of these challenges and solutions and references Mary Jean Harro
 ld’s achievements in these areas. The talk then explores current challen
 ges and opportunities that bring problems that cannot be solved by state o
 f art techniques\, including applications that are machine learning applic
 ations or use machine learning as part of a system where components intera
 ct and evolve. Other challenges that need to be explored involve autonomou
 s systems\, cloud applications\, and data churn. As software becomes more 
 autonomous\, its operations and outputs become less predictable at test wr
 iting time\; hence\, the traditional nature of assert (Actual\, Expected) 
 test oracles does not work and needs to be addressed.\n\nBIO:\n\nMary Lou 
 Soffa is the Owen R. Cheatham Professor of Sciences in the Computer Scienc
 e Department at the University of Virginia\, serving as the department cha
 ir from 2004 to 2012. Her research interests include software testing\, pr
 ogram analysis\, warehouse scale computing\, software systems for multi-co
 re architectures\, and optimizing compilers. She has published over 175 ar
 ticles and has directed 32 Ph.D. students to completion\, half of whom are
  women and including Mary Jean Harrold. Soffa is an ACM and IEEE Fellow. O
 ther notable awards include the Ken Kennedy Award for contributions to com
 piler technology\, the IEEE Software Engineering Women in Science and Engi
 neering Leadership Award\, and the Anita Borg Technical Leadership Award. 
 For her career-long dedication to diversity in computing\, she received th
 e Presidential Award for Excellence in Science\, Mathematics and Engineeri
 ng Mentoring and Computing Research Association (CRA) Nico Habermann Award
 . She has served as conference chair\, program chair\, or program committe
 e member for conferences in programming languages\, architecture\, and sof
 tware engineering. She served on the ACM Publications Board and on the Com
 puter Research Association Board (CRA). She co-founded the CRA-W Graduate 
 Cohort for Women\, the Cohort for Associate Professors and the Grad Cohort

 \nAssistant Professor Sung-Jin Park | Coulter Department of Biomedical Eng
 ineering\, Georgia Institute of Technology & Emory University\, School of 
 Medicine\nAbstract:\n\nBio: My lab\, Biohybrid System Laboratory\, is inte
 rested in elucidating how biological systems coordinate the hierarchical s
 tructures and functions of their individual components\, in order to produ
 ce emergent physical behaviors\, and how disrupting this coordination pote
 ntiates disease. We seek to design\, build\, and test a hierarchy of biohy
 brid systems capable of reproducing the targeted behaviors. Our primary in
 terest is coordinated activation and contraction of tissue- and organ-leve
 l cardiac and skeletal muscle systems. To pursue this goal\, we focus on t
 he development of biohybrid fabrication methods and measurement systems th
 rough the combined application of genetic tools\, induced pluripotent stem
  cells\, tissue engineering\, microfabrication\, electronics\, optics\, an
 d feedback control. The resulting findings and technical developments will
  be translated into various applications such as (1) stem cell-based funct
 ional assays for personalized disease diagnosis and treatment and (2) new 
 types of biohybrid actuators for creating biological autonomous systems.\n

 n\nPlease register [1] to attend this upcoming teaching with technology sp
 otlight session!\n\nEvery semester instructors all over Georgia Tech are p
 roducing and utilizing videos in their courses. Have you ever wondered how
  students are using these resources? Are you concerned that students might
  not be watching the videos or might be skipping through them? Have you ev
 er thought about how you could make your videos more engaging? Watching vi
 deos is a very passive activity--but it doesn’t have to stay that way\, 
 thanks to innovative technologies that allow you to add interactive featur
 es to your videos.\n\nIn this spotlight workshop\, we will explore the tec
 hnology and pedagogy behind Interactive Video Quizzes from Kaltura. We’l
 l examine how you can use Kaltura to create quizzes that exist inside vide
 os and describe how you can best leverage this technology in your own cour
 ses. We’ll also discuss the concept of frequent quizzing and explain how
  such a technique can benefit student learning. And we’ll hear from Dr. 
 Tatiana Rudechenko\, a faculty member in Scheller\, who has successfully i
 mplemented video quizzing in her own course. Tatiana will share her experi
 ence\, lessons learned\, and tips for using this technique with your stude
 nts.\n\nJoin us and learn first-hand about video quizzing and generate ide
 as for innovative uses with your colleagues. Bring your laptop to get a ju
 mp on creating your own video quizzes by engaging in hands-on activities o
 r simply follow along with someone at your table. All are encouraged to at
 tend--from novices who have just started to think about creating videos to
  experts looking to add another tool to their video skill set. We look for
 ward to seeing you!\n\nLunch will be provided. Please register [1] to join
  us!\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.edu/node/628033#0\n[1]  https://ctl.

  (UAM) with electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft is emer
 ging as a promising aviation market for both cargo delivery and passenger 
 travel. The rise of UAM is being driven by the convergence of two technolo
 gies: autonomy and electric aircraft propulsion. Although promising\, thes
 e technologies place limits on the discovery of viable markets\, the timel
 ine of introduction\, and the design of operational paradigms. In particul
 ar\, electric propulsion—when achieved with battery energy storage—is 
 highly constraining in terms of aircraft payload\, range\, and speed perfo
