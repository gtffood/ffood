 le of standards in building a learning ecosystem\, the most important stan
 dards to follow\, and why standards such as Open Badges\, Comprehensive Le

 ntegration\;\n\n2. The importance of learning analytics in advancing effec
 tive practices in course design and pedagogy\, student graduation and rete
 ntion\, and personalization of learning\; and\n\n3. The importance of univ
 ersal design principles to think more broadly about accessibility of learn
 ing resources and to move beyond a course-centric view of learning.\n\nLin

 \nMike Filler\nSchool of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at Georgia 
 Tech\n\nAbstract: The history of silicon is usually told as a history of e
 lectronic materials and devices. However\, it may be better told as a hist
 ory of manufacturing innovation. This talk will take a journey through the
  manufacturing innovations that transformed silicon from its humble beginn
 ings as the most abundant metal in Earth’s crust to the enabler of the c
 omputer chips that underpin the modern economy. The journey begins with th
 e extraction of silicon from sand and its processing into the most composi
 tionally pure and structurally perfect human-made material. It continues t
 hrough the mid-20th century breakthroughs that allowed for the fabrication
  and interconnection of high-quality electronic devices to form integrated
  circuits. It is from this perspective that we can most easily appreciate 
 silicon’s impact on modern society and why it is finding increasing util
 ity in technology areas as diverse as renewable energy\, environmental sen
 sing\, and augmented reality. It is also from this perspective that we can
  understand the limitations of today’s manufacturing paradigm and begin 
 to see what innovations might be necessary to enable silicon’s next act.

 nologies to Improve the Bottom Line\,” Thursday\, Feb. 28\, 2019\, from 
 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. at Georgia Tech’s Renewable Bioproducts Institute on th
 e Atlanta campus.\n\nDelivering our keynote address will be RAPID Manufact
 uring Institute [1] CEO and Georgia Tech alum William Grieco.\n\nIn 2016\,
  the U.S. Department of Energy announced the establishment of the 10th Man
 ufacturing USA Institute\, the Rapid Advancement in Process Intensificatio
 n Deployment (RAPID) Manufacturing Institute. Leveraging up to $70 million
  in federal funding\, RAPID is focused on developing breakthrough technolo
 gies to boost energy productivity and energy efficiency by 20 percent in f
 ive years. RAPID will leverage approaches to modular chemical process inte
 nsification used in a variety of industries. Its focus on renewable biopro
 ducts can be found here [2].\n\nGrieco's senior-level innovation roles hav
 e focused on process development across multiple industries. These include
  the biofuels startup PetroAlgae\, where he and his team built the first-o
 f-a-kind intensive biomass production process to grow and convert aquatic 
 plants to purified proteins and energy feedstocks. For the biopharmaceutic
 al firm Alkermes\, he spearheaded development and commercialization of the
  VIVITROL® and RISPERDAL®\n\nHe serves on the external advisory board fo
 r the Georgia Tech Energy Policy Innovation Center. Grieco has been a memb
 er of AIChE for 25 years\, and chaired the Nanoscale Science and Engineeri
 ng Forum in the mid-2000s.\n\nThe workshop will further explore how RBI is
  changing the way companies look at their bottom line. Listen to RBI affil
 iated faculty present research in areas such as black liquor separation\, 
 multi-phase forming\, corrosion sciences and Factory 4.0\, as well as new 
 products for the future of packaging and barrier protection.\n\nAttendees 
 may also take advantage of one-on-one interactions with graduate students 
 as they share their research a poster session and luncheon at the Paper Tr
 icentennial Building\, home of RBI.\n\nWatch for more details in the comin

 Chancellor "Foley Scholars Research"

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Public\
 , Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\nStatus: published\n\nABSTRACT
 S\n\nMichaelanne Dye\, Towards Access and Beyond: Human Infrastructures in
  Constrained Contexts\n\nMore than four billion people across the world ha
 ve yet to access the internet. Despite increasing initiatives by companies
  and governments to bring more people online\, social\, economic\, and pol
 itical barriers continue to limit internet engagements among underrepresen
 ted groups. As a result\, people collaborate to overcome barriers to parti
 cipation\, particularly in politically and economically constrained contex
 ts. I address these concerns by focusing on the case of Cuba\, where up un
 til recently internet access was limited to just five percent of the popul
 ation. Presenting results from qualitative inquiry in Havana from 2014 to 
 2017\, I describe how participants are receiving and engaging with the inc
 remental introduction of access to the world wide web. I also present insi
 ghts into how people have created their own versions of the internet in re
 sponse to barriers. I draw on the framework of human infrastructure to rev
 eal how people are sustaining multiple\, disconnected information networks
 \, and the tensions and opportunities that arise from these efforts. I wil
 l discuss how this work contributes to our understanding of the social ele
 ments embedded in internet adoption and participation\, and how this criti
 cal understanding has implications for the design of social media systems 
 in order to better support collaborative efforts of historically underrepr
 esented groups.\n\nCaitlyn Seim\, Wearable Tactile Stimulation for Stroke 
 Rehabilitation\n\nStroke is one of the leading causes of disability in the
  United States and globally. Many stroke survivors lose function in their 
 upper extremities\, which can make it difficult to do everyday tasks like 
 dressing or eating. In addition to weakness and loss of sensation\, spasti
 city and tone can cause hands to be involuntarily clenched in a rigid posi
 tion — a problem for which there are few effective treatments. Getting r
 ehabilitation therapy can be a challenge and up to 50% of stroke survivors
  do not qualify for traditional exercise-based therapies. This talk introd
 uces a novel stimulation method and mobile\, wearable devices to provide t
 herapy on-the-go and to those with very limited movement. Preliminary resu
 lts and next steps are presented. Our stimulation method may provide a pow
 erful tool to reduce disability after a stroke\, and the wearable form fac
 tor allows users to receive intensive therapy during their normal daily ro
 utine.\n\nStevie Chancellor\, Human-Centered Algorithms for Deviant Mental
  Health Behaviors Online\n\nSocial media can provide a rich platform for t
 hose seeking better health and support through difficult experiences. Yet\
 , it can also provide space for deviant mental health behaviors\, very dan
 gerous and stigmatized behaviors related to mental health. These behaviors
  are dangerous to participants as well as to platform health. However\, th
 e deep complexities of mental health and these clandestine behaviors resis
 t straightforward\, data-driven approaches to detection and intervention. 
 In this talk\, I will describe how human-centered algorithms can identify 
 and assess deviant mental health behaviors in pro-eating disorder communit
 ies\, bringing insights from Human Computer Interaction\, applied data sci
 ence\, and social computing. In addition\, I will show how these approache
 s can inform platform strategies for engaging with these communities. Fina
 lly\, I will briefly discuss how human-centered insights can be brought to
  computational methods to answer our toughest questions about deviant beha
 vior online.\n\nSPEAKER BIOS\n\nMichaelanne Dye is a Ph.D. candidate in Hu
 man-Centered Computing in the School of Interactive Computing at the Georg
 ia Institute of Technology. Blending the fields of Social Computing and IC
 TD (Information and Communication Technologies and Development)\, her work
  uses qualitative methods to study how people access and participate with 
 internet technologies in resource-constrained contexts with the goal of in
 forming the design of more equitable and inclusive technology. She receive
 d her Master’s in Sociocultural Anthropology from Georgia State Universi
 ty\, and draws heavily on this background to engage in technology research
 . Michaelanne is a Microsoft Research Ph.D. Fellow\, a three-time recipien
 t of the Herz Global Impact Award\, and an American Rewards for College Sc
 ientists (ARCS) Fellow. Her work has received Best Paper Honorable Mention
  awards at the ACM CHI and CSCW conferences.\n\nCaitlyn Seim is a PhD cand
 idate in the School of Interactive Computing at the Georgia Institute of T
 echnology. Her concentration is Human-Centered Computing with focuses on A
 rtificial Intelligence and Neuroscience. She is an NSF Graduate Research F
 ellow and Microsoft Research PhD Fellow. Her research interests include we
 arable computing\, haptics\, HCI\, rehabilitation\, and accessibility. Mor
 e specifically\, her work examines human cognition and learning from hapti
 c interaction\, and creating new lightweight\, mobile devices for rehabili
 tation.\n\nStevie Chancellor is a PhD candidate in Human Centered Computin
 g in Interactive Computing. Her research interest lies in Social Computing
 \, Data Science\, and HCI to understand online communities and mental heal
 th. Stevie’s work has won multiple Best Paper Honorable Mention awards a
 t CHI and CSCW\, premier venues in human computer interaction. Her work ha
 s been supported by a Snap Inc. Research Fellowship and has appeared in na
 tional publications such as Wired and Gizmodo.\n\nHow to watch: If you can

 \nA Frontiers in Science Lecture to celebrate 2019\, the International Yea
 r of the Periodic Table\nThe history of silicon is usually told as a histo
 ry of electronic materials and devices. However\, it is better told as a h
 istory of manufacturing innovation. This talk will take a journey through 
 the manufacturing innovations that transformed silicon from its humble beg
 innings as the most abundant metal in Earth’s crust to the enabler of th
 e computer chips that underpin the modern economy.\n\nThe journey begins w
 ith the extraction of silicon from sand and its processing into the most c
 ompositionally pure and structurally perfect human-made material. It conti
 nues through the mid-20th century breakthroughs that allowed fabrication a
 nd interconnection of high-quality electronic devices to form integrated c
 ircuits.\n\nIt is from this perspective that we can most easily appreciate
  silicon’s impact on modern society and why it is finding increasing uti
 lity in technology areas as diverse as renewable energy\, environmental se
 nsing\, and augmented reality. It is also from this perspective that we ca
 n understand silicon’s limitations and begin to see what innovations mig
 ht be necessary to enable silicon’s next act.\n\nAbout the Speaker\nMich

 :\n\nTouching on computational craft and hybrid fabrication\, this talk lo
 oks at the process of designing and creating story-based interactive exper
 iences and games through crafts and crafted or crafting interfaces. Games 
 are generally fast-paced with responsive controls\, while crafting is ofte
 n a slower\, methodical process. This leads to some interesting design cha
 llenges and novel experiences. The talk will cover some of the projects cr
 eated by the speaker\, including Loominary – a game system that runs Twi
 ne games and uses a tabletop loom as the controller. Through the act of pl
 aying\, the player’s choices are literally woven into a personalized tan
 gible artifact of the player’s game session.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\nDr. Anne
  Sullivan is an Assistant Professor of Digital Media in the School of Lite
 rature\, Media\, and Communication at Georgia Tech. Her work focuses on th
 e ways in which interactive experiences and craft can co-exist with a part
 icular eye towards narrative and storytelling experiences from underrepres
 ented perspectives. Dr. Sullivan is an award winning quilter and the conce
 pt designer and producer of Loominary – a collaborative game system that
  uses a tabletop loom as the controller - which has been shown internation
 ally\, including at the SAAM Arcade exhibit at the Smithsonian American Ar
 t Museum.\n\nHow to watch: If you can't make the event in person you can L

 John G. Michopoulos\, Research Scientist/Engineer Computational Multiphysi
 cs System Lab.\, Code 6394 Center for Materials Physics and Technology Mat
 erial Science and Technology Division US Naval Research Laboratory\n\nAbst
 ract\n\nThe presentation will focus on an overview of modeling\, simulatio
 n (M&S) and experimental activities related to the integrated computationa
 l material engineering efforts at US-NRL from the perspective of the multi
 ple length scales and multiple fields involved in layered deposition proce
 sses as they relate to Navy applications. The efforts described are a part
  of US-NRL’s internally funded effort on the “Science of Layered Depos
 ition Processes”\, grand-challenge effort directed by the speaker.\n\nTh
 e multiscale issues associated with Additive Manufacturing (AM) will be di
 scussed first in order to lay out the scientific motivation of our efforts
 . Then\, a description of overall analytical\, experimental and computatio
 nal components of the framework under development will be presented. Vario
 us aspects and current progress on some of the elements of this framework 
 will be presented.\n\nEmphasis will be given on the solution of the multif
 ield partial differential equations (PDEs) governing the spatio-temporal b
 ehavior of AM processes by using various discretization and model order re
 duction methods. A description of NRL’s AM Multiphysics Discrete Element
  Method\, will also be presented with emphasis on its ability to predict p
 orosity and surface roughness in addition to final part shape for powder-b
 ased AM processes. A methodology is introduce to enriched analytical solut
 ions with functionality relevant to the practicalities of AM processes wil
 l be introduced and their accuracy and efficiency will be discussed from t
 he perspective of enabling closed loop feedback control in real time. Prog
 ress on implicit slicing and multiscale topology optimization for function
 al tailoring of parts will also be presented. Multiphase field methods for
  predicting the evolution of the polycrystalline microstructure of multi-e
 lement alloys will also be outlined. Connection of process parameters to p
 erformance requires utilizing crystal plasticity for generating data-drive
 n constitutive models enabling stress-strain response prediction\, example
 s of which will also be outlined. Finally\, AM part qualification methodol
 ogies introduced by our group will be presented via the use of automated m
 ulti-degree of freedom testing procedures.\n\nBiography\n\nAs a Research S
 cientist/Engineer and head of Computational Multiphysics Systems Lab (CMSL
 ) of the Center for Materials Physics and Technology at the US Naval Resea
 rch Laboratory (US-NRL)\, Dr. Michopoulos oversees and actively participat
 es on research efforts involving multi-physics modeling and simulation ass
 ociated with a plethora of topics in computational and experimental scienc
 es. Some of his current major initiatives include research and development
  on the science of layered deposition processes\, linking performance to m
 aterial through data and specification driven methodologies\, model order 
 reduction for naval applications\, electromagnetic launcher dissipative da
 mage modeling and simulation\, mechatronic/robotic data-driven characteriz
 ation of continua\, and multiphysics design optimization. He is a member o
 f the editorial board of several scientific journals and is member of the 
 program committee of several international conferences and has chaired sev
 eral of them. He has served in the executive committee of the Computers an
 d Information in engineering division of the ASME among others. His techni
 cal work and leadership have been recognized by several national and inter
 national honors\, including the 2015 Excellence in Research award by ASME
 ’s CIE division\, the 2015 Innovator Award by Wolfram Inc.\, and the 201
 3 “P.S. Theocaris” award for excellence by the National Academy of Ath
 ens. He has authored and co-authored more than 270 publications and patent
 s and his a Fellow of the ASME. Dr. Michopoulos holds an M.Sc. In Civil En
 gineering and a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics and Mechanics from the Nation
 al Technical University of Athens\, and has pursued post-doctoral studies 
 at Lehigh University on computational multi-field modeling of continua and
  Fracture Mechanics.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.edu/node/617809#0\n[

 cing the new Associate Director of CREATE-X Startup Launch\n\nIf you are f
 amiliar with startups\, you have probably heard the term VC or Venture Cap
 ital\, but what does it mean? How do startups gain venture capital? Startu
 p Launch Associate Director\, Rahul Saxena\, was a venture capitalist for 
 10 years at the Seraph Group. Learn how VC's think\, operate\, and why it 
 could be the best and worst decision to partner with them.\n\nAbout Deep S
 tartups\n\nDeep Startups is an Idea Series that features knowledgeable ent
 repreneurs who discuss their experiences forming companies that solve big-
 picture current problems. These individuals speak to the concept of ‘dee
 p startups’ and how to create companies that make a difference. Each Dee
 p Startups event focuses on a different broad topic in engineering/technol
 ogy and allows for student Q&A at the end of the event.\n\nAbout Rahul Sax
 ena\n\nRahul Saxena is the Associate Director for CREATE-X Launch. In his 
 role\, he works with students to help them launch and scale successful sta
 rtups. Leading up to this role\, Rahul had a career as a Venture Capitalis
 t\, startup CEO\, entrepreneur\, mechatronic design engineer\, and publish
 ed academic researcher. He received a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from 
 Georgia Tech where he also conducted research on the fluid mechanics of me
 chanical heart valves\, both as an undergrad and then as a research engine
 er. He then pursued a European Masters at the von Karman Institute for Flu
 id Mechanics under a NATO fellowship.\n\nAfter returning\, Rahul went to S
 ilicon Valley where he worked as a mechatronic engineer at a startup compa
 ny that was developing and selling high-throughput automation equipment fo
 r genetics research. As the bubble burst\, he moved back to Atlanta where 
 he worked on a few different startups while also pursuing his MBA at Emory
  University's Goizueta School of Business.\n\nAfter finishing the degree\,
  he joined an early-stage venture capital firm\, Seraph Group\, where he w
 orked for 10 years evaluating and investing in companies while also servin
 g on several Boards of companies that went on to be acquired. During this 
 time\, Rahul took a direct operating role as CEO of one of its portfolio c
 ompanies that faced numerous issues and was able to successfully exit it t
 o the leading provider in the market. The company is a SaaS provider to go
 vernment agencies for one of the leading restaurant permitting and inspect
 ions software.\n\nFood will be served.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.ed

 \nBernard Kippelen\nSchool of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Georg
 ia Tech\nAbstract: In this talk\, we will discuss how printable organic co
 njugated semiconducting molecules and polymers are creating new disruptive
  technologies that are impacting all industries. We will present recent ad
 vances in various solid-state device platforms including\, organic light-e
 mitting diodes (OLEDs)\, organic photodetectors (OPDs)\, organic photovolt
 aic devices (OPVs)\, and organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs). We will em
 phasize the importance of interfaces in devices and show examples on how t
 o engineer their electrical properties. We will present a simple processin
 g technique for the electrical doping of organic semiconductors over a lim
 ited depth near the surface of the film that is based on immersing the fil
 m into a polyoxometalate solution. Such approached can drastically reduce 
 the fabrication cost of such devices\, simplify device architecture\, and 
 lead to all-organic devices fabricated by all-additive printing techniques
 . As an illustration of the simplicity and versatility of this process we 
 will discuss how high-performance organic solar cells with simplified arch
 itecture can be implemented. Finally\, we will present the results of a de
 tailed operational lifetime study of OTFTs showing that organic photonics 
 and electronics can yield a stability level superior to that of amorphous 
 silicon.\n\nBio: Bernard Kippelen is the Joseph M. Pettit Professor of Ele

 \nABSTRACT\n\nSemiconductor and plasmonic nanocrystals are known for their
  size and shape dependent photo-luminescence and localized surface plasmon
  resonances\, respectively. In this talk\, I will describe the use of semi
 conductor and plasmonic nanocrystals as building blocks of mesoscale mater
 ials for semiconductor electronics and optoelectronics and plasmonic optic
 al metamaterials. Chemical exchange of the long ligands used in nanocrysta
 l synthesis with more compact ligand chemistries brings neighboring nanocr
 ystals into proximity and increases interparticle coupling. In semiconduct
 or nanocrystal solids\, we show strong electronic coupling in combination 
 with doping allows us to control the carrier type and concentration to des
 ign high mobility n- and p-type materials. I will give examples where n- a
 nd p-type nanocrystal solids are used to construct field-effect transistor
 s and integrated circuits and solar photovoltaics. In metal nanocrystals\,
  ligand-controlled coupling allows us to tailor a dielectric-to-metal phas
 e transition seen by a 1010 range in DC conductivity and a dielectric perm
 ittivity ranging from everywhere positive to everywhere negative across th
 e whole range of optical frequencies. We realize a "diluted metal" with op
 tical properties not found in the bulk metal analog\, presenting a new axi
 s in plasmonic materials design and the realization of optical properties 
 akin to next-generation metamaterials. We harness the properties of metal 
 nanocrystals by using nanoimprint lithography to print large-area metamate
 rials on glass and plastics with widely tailorable optical properties that
  are used to realize near-infrared optical devices.\n\nABOUT THE SPEAKER\n
 \nCherie R. Kagan is the Stephen J. Angello Professor of Electrical and Sy
 stems Engineering\, Professor of Materials Science and Engineering\, and P
 rofessor of Chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania. Kagan is also an 
 Associate Editor of ACS Nano. She graduated from the University of Pennsyl
 vania in 1991 with a BSE in Materials Science and Engineering and a BA Mat
 hematics and earned her PhD in Materials Science and Engineering from the 
 Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1996. In 1996\, she went to Bell 
 Labs as a postdoctoral fellow and in 1998\, she joined IBM’s T. J. Watso
 n Research Center\, where she most recently managed the “Molecular Assem
 blies and Devices Group.” In 2007\, she joined the faculty of the Univer
 sity of Pennsylvania. The Kagan group’s research is focused on studying 
 the chemical and physical properties of nanostructured materials and in in
 tegrating these materials in electronic\, optoelectronic\, and optical dev
 ices. The group combines the flexibility of chemistry and bottom-up assemb
 ly with top-down fabrication techniques to design novel materials and devi
 ces and explores the structure and function of these materials and their d
 evices.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.edu/node/618594#0\n[1]  http://st

 \nTime-Frequency Analysis for Frequency Modulated Signals\nProf. Yimin Zha
 ng\nAssociate Professor at Temple University\n\nAbstract. This talk will d
 iscuss time-frequency analysis methods and applications for FM signals usi
 ng both single-sensor and multi-sensor systems. We first review the interp
 layed role of the spatial dimension and time-frequency representation for 
 improved time-frequency signature characterization\, source discrimination
 \, and signal enhancement. We then introduce recent advances of nonstation
 ary signal analysis and array processing in the following two areas: (a) N
 onparametric instantaneous frequency estimation of multi-component signals
  with closely separated time-varying frequency signatures\, and (b) Sparse
  reconstruction of time-frequency signatures and instantaneous frequency e
 stimation for FM signals with random missing time entries. These methods a
 re supported by application examples including DOA estimation\, target loc
 alization\, and interference mitigation.\n\nBiography. Dr. Zhang graduated
  from Xidian University\, China\, and received his Ph.D. degree from the U
 niversity of Tsukuba\, Japan. He is currently an Associate Professor at th
 e Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering\, Temple University. H
 is general research interests lie in the areas of statistical signal and a
 rray processing\, time-frequency analysis\, compressive sensing\, and conv
 ex optimization for applications in radar\, wireless communications\, and 
 satellite navigation. He is an Associate Professor for IEEE Transactions o
 n Signal Processing\, an Associate Editor for the Signal Processing journa
 l\, and is a member of the Sensor Array and Multichannel (SAM) Technical C
 ommittee and the Signal Processing Theory and Methods (SPTM) Technical Com
 mittee of the IEEE Signal Processing Society. He received the 2016 IET Rad
 ar\, Sonar & Navigation Premium Award\, 2017 IEEE AESS Mimno Award\, and i
 s a coauthor of a paper receiving the 2018 IEEE SPS Young Author Best Pape

 , Undergraduate students\nStatus: published\n\nPresented by Serve-Learn-Su
 stain\, in partnership with School of History and Sociology (through a gra
 nt from the Gertrude and William C. Wardlaw Fund in support of the Confere
 nce on Human Rights\, Changes and Challenges).\n\nThis event explores the 
 question\, "what are the most successful interventions in cultivating comm
 unity health\, especially in communities that have been traditionally marg
 inalized?" This guiding question entails examining how health-related orga
 nizations and agencies differently define "good health" and how access to 
 power (political\, cultural\, and financial) impacts how community members
  interact with health-related resources and technologies. In conjunction w
 ith our Serve-Learn-Sustain Linked Courses Program focused on Community He
 alth\, this event also investigates the concept of "community health." In 
 the framework used in our program [1]\, individual health and community he
 alth are symbiotic - with community health dependent on the health behavio
 rs and health outcomes of individuals within the community and individual 
 health dependent on the health status of the community.\n\nThe first panel
  will focus on community health at the local and regional registers\, whil
 e the second panel will engage global perspectives\; however\, both panels
  will highlight the connectedness of local and global community health cha
 llenges and innovations. Featured panelists include Sagdrina Jalal of the 
 Georgia Farmer's Market Association\, David Addiss of the Task Force for G
 lobal Health\, Hope Bussenius and Charles Moore of Emory's Urban Health In
 itiative\, Rihana Nesrudin of Oakhurst Medical Center\, Angelou Ezeilo of 
 the Greening Youth Foundation\, and two Youth Leadership Team members of t
 he International Rescue Committee. Hence\, the symposium also explores how
  professionals from different disciplines and sectors view the concept of 
 "community health" through the specific lenses of the communities--whether
  here in Atlanta or abroad-- with which they work. We hope you can join us
  for both panels\, and enjoy lunch and conversation during the time in bet
 ween!\n\nTwo Sessions: 11:00am - 12:00pm (Morning Session - Community Heal
 th: Focus on Georgia )\; 12:30pm - 1:45pm (Afternoon Session - Community H
 ealth: Widen the Lens) Lunch will be offered during the session break betw
 een 12:00pm - 12:30pm\n​About Liam Rattray & Liam's Legacy:\n\nThe Liam'
 s Legacy Symposium honors the memory of Liam Rattray\, an outstanding and 
 socially-committed Georgia Tech Honors Program student who was tragically 
 killed by a drunk driver just a few weeks after his graduation\, in 2011. 
 We mourn his death\, but we also celebrate his life in this annual event t
 hat carries his name and draws upon his legacy of engagement and activism.

 :\n\nCapitalism is when private entities control the means of production. 
 It has been critiqued as causing vast social and economic inequality. Wher
 e might designers be able to intervene within the pervasive social and eco
 nomic problems created by capitalism? My research examines wage theft\, wh
 ich is when a worker is legally denied benefits or wages by their employer
  or manager. Wage theft is a pervasive and massive problem for low-wage wo
 rkers in capitalist systems. In this talk\, I discuss empirical results fr
 om interviews with low-wage workers\, employers\, pro-worker advocates\, a
 nd computing technologists. I highlight key challenges that inhibit just f
 utures of work within capitalism\, including material and institutional co
 nstraints\, overt politics\, and compromised resistance tactics. Specifica
 lly\, I describe the data\, design\, and technology-oriented activist prac
 tices of pro-worker advocates and the compromises and constraints they enc
 ounter when working with and advocating on behalf of low-wage workers. The
 se practices can inform the design strategies and outcomes of computing te
 chnologists designing socio-technical tools to address wage theft. Lastly\
 , I conclude with insights for research and practice.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\nL
 ynn Dombrowski is an assistant professor in Informatics at Indiana Univers
 ity - Purdue University - Indianapolis (IUPUI). Her primary focus is withi
 n Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and design research. She focuses on und
 erstanding\, designing\, and evaluating technologies that work to address 
 social issues and seeks to identify key sociotechnical strategies for deal
 ing with oppression and social inequalities. She often works alongside mar
 ginalized communities and community partners.\n\nHow to watch: If you can'

 \nAbstract: Transistor scaling is expected to soon reach its theoretical l
 imits\, diverging from Moores Law predictions and forcing the semiconducto
 r industry to rethink its integration strategy beyond silicon. Packaging\,
  until recently was treated as an afterthought\, but now is seen as a key 
 enabler to further increase functional densities\, and meet the stringent 
 performance and miniaturization requirements of emerging applications. A r
 adical departure from existing roadmaps is now being pursued with the inte
 rconnect fabric paradigm\, relying on the interconnection of functionally 
 diverse dielets as micro-systems\, and is expected to drive assembly pitch
 es below 5Âµm\, far beyond the fundamental limits of traditional solders
 . My vision for the evolution of off-chip interconnection and assembly tec
 hnologies to meet the pitch scaling\, increasing thermal\, electrical\, re
 liability and processing requirements of heterogeneous integration\, with 
 a focus on high-volume manufacturing\, will be presented in the seminar. B
 oth experimental and numerical modeling are necessary to make further prog
 ress\, including: (1) incorporation of new solid-state joining and sinteri
 ng methods relying on nanostructured nanoporous metals\; (2) System reliab
 ility becomes more critical without a compliant layer such as solder to ab
 sorb thermal expansion stresses. A new research thrust is proposed to expl
 ore low-stress conductors such as Cu-graphene composites with novel manufa
 cturing paths for their adoption as substrate metallization\, Cu functiona
 lization\, or CTE-matched heat sinks for direct chip cooling. (3) Novel na
 noscale joining techniques are also proposed as the next frontier for high
 -throughput\, high-precision assembly. These breakthrough technologies wil
 l be illustrated in the light of two applications: HPC and power electroni
 cs\, with a focus on reliability and condition monitoring as a new interdi
 sciplinary and collaborative research pole to create at GT.\n\nBiography: 
 Dr. Vanessa Smet received her B.S. (2004) and M.S. (2007) in Applied Physi
 cs from the Ecole Normale Superieure and Paris XI University and her Ph.D.
  (2010) in Electronics from Montpellier University in France. She has taug
 ht undergraduate courses for 3 years at Montpelier University as part of t
 he AgrÃ©gation in Applied Physics\, a French National recruitment exam f
 or teachers in college-level education. She was a post-doctoral research f
 ellow with the Heterogeneous Integration group at Tyndall National Institu
 te (Ireland) in 2010-2012. Since 2012\, she has been affiliated with the 3
 D Systems Packaging Research Center (PRC) at Georgia Tech where she has be
 en responsible for driving research efforts in two primary areas: 1) inter
 connections and assembly and 2) power electronics packaging. Her current r
 esearch interests include low-cost synthesis of bulk nanocomposites of Cu-
 graphene as low-CTE conductors\, nanoporous metals for smart assembly in n
 ext-gen heterogeneous systems as well as power electronics packaging\, rel
 iability and condition monitoring in self-driving cars. During her time at
  GT she has managed over $4M in research programs\, over $2M of which she 
 initiated as PI or Co-PI through PRC's industry Consortium\, and external 
 sponsors such as SRC and ARPA-E programs. She also established collaborati
 ons with several tool companies\, resulting in the placement of a producti
 on-graded thermocompression tool at GT of a $1M value. She currently direc
 tly supervises 5 PhD and 1 MS student\, and mentors 3 PhD students that ar
 e advised by PRC affiliated faculty. While at GT\, Dr. Smet has lectured i

 tract:\n\nA growing number of commercial and enterprise systems are increa
 singly relying on compute-intensive machine learning algorithms. While the
  demand for these applications is growing\, the performance benefits from 
 general-purpose platforms is diminishing. This challenge has coincided wit
 h the explosion of data where the rate of data generation has reached an o
 verwhelming level that is beyond the capabilities of current computing sys
 tems. Therefore\, the ever-increasing compute needs of applications such a
 s machine learning and robotics can benefit from hardware acceleration.\n\
 nTraditionally\, to accelerate a set of workloads\, we profile the code op
 timized for CPUs and offload the hot functions on compute units designed s
 pecially for that particular function\, hence providing higher performance
  and energy efficiency. Instead in this work\, we take a revolutionary app
 roach where we delve into the algorithmic properties of an application dom
 ain and couple them with our hardware acceleration solutions. We leverage 
 the property that a wide range of machine learning algorithms can be model
 ed as stochastic optimization problems\; and use this property to devise c
 omprehensive stacks that are built independent of the CPU. These stacks ex
 pose a high-level mathematical programming interface and can automatically
  generate accelerators for users who have limited knowledge about hardware
  design but can benefit from large performance and efficiency gains for th
 eir programs.\n\nKeeping these ambitious goals in mind\, our work (1) stri
 kes a balance between generality and specialization by breaking the long-h
 eld traditional abstraction of the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) in f
 avor of a more algorithm-centric approach\; (2) develops hardware accelera
 tion frameworks by co-designing a language\, compiler\, runtime system\, a
 nd hardware to provide high performance and efficiency\, in addition to fl
 exibility and programmability\; (3) segregates algorithmic specification f
 rom implementation to shield the programmer from continual hardware/softwa
 re modifications while allowing them to benefit from the emerging heteroge
 neity of modern compute platforms\; and (4) develops real cross-stack prot
 otypes to evaluate these innovative solutions in a real-world setting and 
 make them open-source to maximize community engagement and industry impact
 . Our work Tabla ( [1] ) is public\, and defines the very first open-sourc
 e hardware platforms for machine learning and artificial intelligence.\n\n

 \n\nSummary\n\nThe ability to obtain energy from natural environments is o
 f fundamental importance to an animal’s survival and depends on both fin
 ding food and metabolizing it into a useful molecular source of energy. As
  organisms encounter new environments\, feeding strategies and metabolic n
 etworks can be out of balance with new potential dietary sources\, creatin
 g evolutionary pressure for animals to adapt. In my doctoral thesis\, I st
 udied two how two laboratory strains of C. elegans\, N2 and LSJ2\, adapted
  to new food sources. I will first describe my finding that how the pleiot
 ropic traits of two derived alleles of neural genes npr-1 and glb-5 in N2 
 regulate fitness effects to adapt to the new food source. Second\, I will 
 describe my finding that identification of a beneficial de novo complex ge
 nomic rearrangements at rcan-1 gene\, an ortholog of human Down Syndrome c
 orrelated gene RCAN1/DSCR1. This complex rearrangement provides animal ano
 ther strategy to adapt to the new food source. In the last part\, I will d
 escribe the work to identify the adaptive alleles and their fitness effect
 s under different environments including three different feeding condition
 s\, two different temperatures\, and the growth condition with anthelminti
 c drugs. My doctoral thesis research demonstrates that laboratory evolutio
 n can serve as a powerful tool to study the genetic and phenotypic basis t
 hat regulate fitness in metazoan.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.edu/nod

  and Materials Science\nAbstract: Perovskite Chalcogenides are a new class
  of semiconductors which have tunable band gap in the visible to infrared 
 part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Besides this band gap tunability\, t
 hey offer a unique opportunity to realize large density of states semicond
 uctors with high carrier mobility. In this talk\, I will discuss some of t
 he experimental advances made both in my research group and in the researc
 h community on the theory\, synthesis of these materials and understanding
  their optoelectronic properties. Perovskite chalcogenides have a large st
 ructural and chemical phase\, which allows us finer knobs to tailor light-
 matter interaction precisely over a broad energy range spanning the visibl
 e to infrared spectrum. I will show that controlling dimensionality of the
 se materials has profound influence on the light-matter interaction\, whic
 h results in novel properties such as highly anisotropic absorption and re
 fraction\, unconventional band gap evolution. Finally\, I will provide a g
 eneral outlook for future studies on these exciting new class of materials

 ree food\nStatus: published\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThis lecture will focus on the 
 design of systems wherein reconfiguration of complex liquid emulsions (dro
 plets) can be triggered chemically or biochemically. The utility of these 
 methods is to generate new transduction mechanisms by which chemical and b
 iological sensors can be developed. Complex liquid droplets behave as opti
 cal lens systems and small changes in surface tensions can change focal le
 ngths or cause systems to switch between optically transmissive or scatter
 ing states. Central to this scheme is that the fluids in the droplets have
  different densities and hence are aligned by the earth’s gravity. The i
 nduced optical changes can be triggered with chemical\, photochemical\, or
  biochemical stimuli and thereby create new generations of sensors. Demons
 trations of these methods for the detection of enzyme concentrations and p
 athogens will be presented.\n\nABOUT THE SPEAKER\n\nTimothy M. Swager is t
 he John D. MacArthur Professor of Chemistry and the Director\, Deshpande C
 enter for Technological Innovation at the Massachusetts Institute of Techn
 ology. A native of Montana\, he received a BS from Montana State Universit
 y in 1983 and a Ph.D. from the California Institute of Technology in 1988.
  After a postdoctoral appointment at MIT he was on the chemistry faculty a
 t the University of Pennsylvania 1990-1996 and returned to MIT in 1996 as 
 a Professor of Chemistry and served as the Head of Chemistry from 2005-201
 0. He has published more than 450 peer-reviewed papers and more than 90 is
 sued/pending patents. Swager’s honors include: Election to the National 
 Academy of Sciences\, an Honorary Doctorate from Montana State University\
 , The Pauling Medal\, The Lemelson-MIT Award for Invention and Innovation\
 , Election to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences\, The American Che
 mical Society Award for Creative Invention\, The American Chemical Society
  Award in Polymer Chemistry\, The Christopher Columbus Foundation Homeland
  Security Award\, and The Carl S. Marvel Creative Polymer Chemistry Award 
 (ACS).\n\nSwager’s research interests are in design\, synthesis\, and st
 udy of organic-based electronic\, sensory\, high-strength and liquid cryst
 alline materials. His liquid crystal designs demonstrated shape complement
 arity to generate specific interactions between molecules and includes fun
 damental mechanisms for increasing liquid crystal order by a new mechanism
  referred to as minimization of free volume. Swager’s research in electr
 onic polymers has been mainly directed at the demonstration of new concept
 ual approaches to the construction of sensory materials. These methods are
  the basis of the FidoTM explosives detectors (FLIR Systems Inc)\, which h
 ave the highest sensitivity of any explosives sensor. Other areas actively
  investigated by the Swager group include radicals for dynamic nuclear pol
 arization\, applications of nano-carbon materials\, organic photovoltaic m
 aterials\, polymer actuators\, and luminescent molecular probes for medica
 l diagnostics. He is the cofounder of 3 companies and has served on a numb
 er of corporate and government boards.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.ed

 bstract\nAfter complete spinal cord injury (SCI)\, adult cats recover hind
 limb locomotion after a few weeks of treadmill training. This recovery is 
 due to the presence of a spinal locomotor central pattern generator (CPG)\
 , which is thought to be reactivated by sensory feedback from the moving l
 egs. One of the central tenets of motor rehabilitation is that training mu
 st be task specific. However\, as the locomotor CPG is present at birth\, 
 we hypothesized that task-specific training is not required to restore loc
 omotion after complete SCI. To test this hypothesis\, we investigated whet
 her providing non-task-specific training in the form of rhythmic manual st
 imulation of the triceps surae muscles restored hindlimb locomotion after 
 complete SCI in cats. Twelve adult cats (>10 months) were divided into thr
 ee groups and implanted with electrodes to chronically record muscle activ
 ity (EMG\, electromyography). After collecting data in the intact state\, 
 we transected the spinal cord at low thoracic levels. Group 1 received rhy
 thmic manual stimulation of the triceps surae muscles\, Group 2 received t
 raditional treadmill training while Group 3 received no treatment. Cats in
  all three groups recovered full body weight support during standing one w
 eek after SCI. Six weeks after SCI\, cats in all groups performed full wei
 ght bearing hindlimb locomotion from 0.1 to 0.8 m/s. The results indicate 
 that the recovery of hindlimb locomotion after complete SCI does not requi
 re task-specific training and is partly spontaneous\, consistent with the 
 hypothesis that the spinal cord produces locomotion as its default pattern
 .\n\nMore about the Speaker\nDr. Alain Frigon has a broad background in ne
 uroscience and kinesiology\, with specific expertise in spinal cord neurop
 hysiology and locomotor control. For the past 15 years\, his research has 
 focused on the neural control of rhythmic movements (arm cycling\, locomot
 ion and scratching) and on neurophysiological changes that take place afte
 r spinal cord or peripheral nerve injury. He received experimental trainin
 g in motor control in humans (E. Paul Zehr) and with the cat model in thre
 e different laboratories that use complementary preparations\, including i
 n vivo recordings in awake behaving cats (Serge Rossignol)\, intracellular
 /extracellular recordings in curarized decerebrate cats (Jean-Pierre Gossa
 rd) and electromyography and force recordings in immobilized decerebrate c
 ats (Charles J. Heckman). His lab currently uses a range of experimental t
 echniques to study the control of movement in the cat and is funded by the
  Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the Natural Sciences and Engin
 eering Research Council of Canada.\n\nPhysiology Brownbag Seminars\nThe Ph

  daily work stress can be impaired when employees experience greater spill
 over of work stress to off-job time\, which can influence employee health\
 , well-being\, and performance. In this talk\, I present research demonstr
 ating unique insights that can be gained when expanding the study of stres
 s spillover and recovery beyond the occupational\, temporal\, and methodol
 ogical boundaries that have historically characterized this research area.
  Empirical work to be discussed will highlight employment contexts (e.g.\,
  working students)\, temporal windows (e.g.\, the commute between work and
  home)\, and methodological approaches (e.g.\, objective behavior monitori
 ng) that have been under-emphasized in past stress spillover and recovery 
 research. I will conclude with a discussion of opportunities and challenge
 s in expanding the scope of stress spillover and recovery research to thes

 es on investigating how employees perceive\, respond to\, and recover from
  work stress.\n\nHe also looks at how individual and work characteristics 
 contribute to the integration of work with other areas of life\, with a re

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Public\
 , Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\nStatus: published\n\nAbstract
 :\n\nHigh tech is a sector where job opportunities exist but go unfilled. 
 Even with extensive effort to recruit women\, women and other populations 
 continue to be underrepresented compared to other professions. More import
 antly\, when hired\, women are twice as likely to leave mid-career than me
 n. Today attrition costs companies 16B a year. At this time when workers a
 re needed and when studies find that diversity aids innovation and the bot
 tom line we must turn our focus to what goes on within the daily life of t
 ech companies to understand what helps people thrive.\n\nRecognizing this 
 void\, Karen Holtzblatt\, well known thought leader in user centered desig
 n\, launched The WIT Retention Project while at Stanford. Starting with in
 -depth field interviews her team talked with successful women in high tech
 \, ages late 20s to 50s. Through a 360° inquiry into the daily lives of s
 uccessful women developers\, product managers\, UX professionals\, and man
 agers Karen and her team identified critical factors affecting retention. 
 The resulting @Work Experience Framework defines these factors which can g
 uide companies to retain technical women.\n\nGuided by the data and the fa
 ctors\, Karen and her world-wide collaborators have developed practical in
 terventions iterated with real tech professionals and teams. These include
  the Career Power board game facilitating serious conversations while havi
 ng fun\; the Team Onboarding Checklist helping new hires connect and achie
 ve success\; Team Techniques improving interactions between team members i
 n working meetings\; Critique practices to ensure egoless feedback and mor
 e. In 2018 Karen launched the non-profit WITops to continue the work.\n\nI
 n this talk Karen introduces the @Work Experience Framework and shares som
 e of the findings from the research. Participants gain insight into their 
 own experiences or how their organization can better support women and div
 erse people at work.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\nKaren Holtzblatt is a thought lead
 er\, industry speaker\, and author. She is Executive Director of WITops\, 
 CEO at InContext Design\, and Research Scientist for the University of Mar
 yland. Karen has more than 30 years of teaching experience\, professionall
 y and in university settings. She regularly consults with universities to 
 help improve their HCI programs – including building in an awareness of 
 issues that new workers\, especially diverse people\, will face. Karen hol
 ds a doctorate in applied psychology from the University of Toronto.\n\nHo

 nStatus: published\n\nAccording to a survey that the Center for Teaching a
 nd Learning conducted last year\, about 40% of the 574 students who respon
 ded said their instructors used clickers effectively in class. These stude
 nts also tended to agree that using clickers helped their learning and wis
 hed that more of their classes would use them. Other students considered u
 sing clickers less beneficial to their learning.\n\nWhat does it take to m
 ake clickers support student learning? How can we use them as an efficient
  means to identify and address students' misconceptions during class? How 
 might we leverage the potential of clickers to facilitate learning activit
 ies that are often challenging to implement in large classes?\n\nIn this w
 orkshop\, we will share what our survey revealed about student perceptions
  of what could be done to help them learn with the use of clickers. In add
 ition\, several faculty from different disciplines who have extensive expe
 rience with using clickers will share their strategies and techniques. Ple
 ase come and join your colleagues for a discussion on how to use clickers 
 to challenge and engage students for better learning experiences and outco

 hy do electrons form “shells\,” as seen in the periodic table?\n\nWhy 
 does the first shell hold 2 electrons\, the second 8\, and the third 18: t
 wice the square numbers 1\, 4\, and 9?\n\nIt took many years to solve thes
 e mysteries\, and a lot of detective work in chemistry\, physics\, and ult
 imately – once the relevant laws of physics were known – mathematics.\
 n\nOther mysteries remain unsolved\, like the mass of the heaviest possibl
 e element. This talk will give a quick tour of these puzzles and some of t
 he answers.\n\nAbout the Speaker\nJohn Baez [2] is a professor of mathemat
 ics at the University of California\, Riverside\, who also works at the Ce
 ntre for Quantum Technologies [3]\, in Singapore. His Internet column “T
 his Week’s Finds” [4] dates back to 1993 and is sometimes called the w
 orld’s first blog.\n\nBaez used to work on quantum gravity and pure math
 ematics. In 2010\, concerned about climate change and the future of the pl
 anet\, he switched to working on a general theory of networks that appear 
 in human-engineered and biological systems.\n\nAbout Frontiers in Science 
 Lectures\nLectures in this series are intended to inform\, engage\, and in

 op and pilot solutions. In this talk\, I will present one specific project
 : An assessment of SMS fraud in Pakistan. There is the concern that widesp
 read scams initiated by SMS have a negative impact on the low income popul
 ation that are the target of financial inclusion initiatives. To investiga
 te this we collected fraudulent SMS messages in Pakistan through various m
 eans and conducted a range of consumer and stakeholder interviews. Based o
 n our analysis\, SMS fraud is dominated by lottery type schemes\, which ha
 ve the greatest impact on vulnerable\, low-income rural populations. To de
 tect SMS fraud\, we offer a simple heuristic for fraud detection that has 
 a high accuracy rate and is adaptable to evolving fraud schemes. We develo
 p a recommendation of a fraud mitigation strategy based on targeting fraud
 ster call back numbers.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\nRichard is a Professor of Compu
 ter Science and Engineering\, where he has been on the faculty since 1986\
 , with brief leaves to Indian Institute of Science\, Microsoft Research\, 
 and PATH. His research has focused on computing for the developing world s
 ince 2005\, when he became involved with the Digital Study Hall project. I
 n 2009\, Richard spent a sabbatical year working with the Digital Health S
 olutions group at PATH\, a global health NGO based in Seattle. This opport
 unity allowed him to increase his efforts on applying computing technologi
 es to challenges in global health. While working with PATH\, he co-founded
  the Projecting Health project\, which uses the Community-Led Video Educat
 ion model to promote healthy practices in rural areas in India. Back at Un
 iversity of Washington\, he is now overseeing the efforts of the Open Data
  Kit project. His research interests in ICTD include technologies for beha
 vior change communication\, improving tools to support the use of data in 
 strengthening health systems\, and digital financial services.\n\nHow to w

 \nThe Cybersecurity Lecture Series at Georgia Tech [1] is a free\, one-hou

 security and privacy. Invited speakers include executives and researchers 
 from Fortune 500 companies\, federal intelligence agencies\, start-ups\, a
 nd incubators\, as well as Georgia Tech faculty and students presenting th
 eir research. Lectures are open to all -- students\, faculty\, industry\, 
 government\, or simply the curious.\n\nRSVP [2]\n\nAbstract:\nWhile Artifi
 cial Intelligence (AI) has tremendous potential as a defense against real-
 world cybersecurity threats\, understanding the capabilities and robustnes
 s of AI remains a fundamental challenge\, especially in adversarial enviro
 nments. In this talk\, I address two interrelated problems that are essent
 ial to the successful deployment of AI in security settings. (1) Discoveri
 ng real-world vulnerabilities of deep neural networks and countermeasures 
 to mitigate threats. I will present ShapeShifter\, the first targeted phys
 ical adversarial attack that fools state-of-the-art object detectors\, and
  SHIELD\, a real-time defense that removes adversarial noise by stochastic
  data compression. (2) Developing theoretically-principled methods for cho
 osing machine models to defend against unknown future attacks. I will intr
 oduce a novel game theory concept called “diversified strategy” to hel
 p make the optimal decision with limited risk. Finally\, I will share my v
 ision on making AI more robust under different threat models\, and researc
 h directions on deploying AI in security-critical and high-stakes problems
 .\n\nBio:\nShang-Tse Chen [3] is a Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science at 
 Georgia Tech. He works in the intersection of applied and theoretical mach
 ine learning. His research focuses on designing robust machine learning al
 gorithms for security-critical applications. He has worked closely with in
 dustry and government partners. His research has led to patent-pending cyb
 er threat detection technology with Symantec\, open-sourced adversarial at
 tack and defense tools with Intel\, deployed fire risk prediction system w
 ith the Atlanta Fire Rescue Department. He is a recipient of the KDD Best 
 Student Paper Runner-up Award (2016) and the IBM Ph.D. Fellowship (2018).\

 nsforming Polymers into Hybrid Materials: Processing Kinetics and Applicat
 ions\nMark Losego\, Assistant Professor\n\nGeorgia Institute of Technology
 \n\nAbstract:\n\nVapor phase infiltration (VPI) is a new processing techno
 logy for infusing polymers with inorganic constituents to create unique or
 ganic-inorganic hybrid materials with novel chemical\, electrical\, optica
 l\, and physical properties. These new materials have been used in applica
 tions ranging from energy harvesting to filtration media to photolithograp
 hic hard masks. This talk will focus on our experimental and theoretical d
 evelopment of a fundamental phenomenological model to measure and describe
  the VPI processing kinetics and create a pathway for rational design of m
 aterial composition and structure. By measuring VPI compositional profiles
  as a function of position\, time\, and temperature\, we can extract funda
 mental energy barriers for the sorption\, diffusion\, and reaction process
 es and delineate amongst different rate limiting steps. In our materials d
 evelopment\, we often find that partial infiltration of a polymer film\, f
 iber\, or foam is sufficient to impart desired properties\; so rational de
 sign of the infiltration kinetics can enable desired performance without w
 aste in processing time or materials. Here\, we will demonstrate several e
 xamples including our work to create chemically insoluble polymers and mem
 branes. We find\, for example\, that infiltration depths of about 0.75 mic
 rons are sufficient to yield PMMA chemically insoluble in organic solvents
  regardless of whether it is in a thin film geometry or a macroscopic plex
 iglass object of centimeters in dimension. We are also applying similar me
 thods to microporous polymer membranes to make them insoluble and resistan
 t to swelling in aggressive organic solvents to further expand membrane-ba
 sed chemical separations technology.\n\nBiography:\n\nMark D. Losego is an
  Assistant Professor in the School of Materials Science and Engineering at
  the Georgia Institute of Technology. The Losego Lab focuses on materials 
 processing and develops novel organic-inorganic hybrid materials systems f
 or sustainable energy\, national security\, and technical textile applicat
 ions. The Losego Lab combines a unique set of solution and vapor phase pro
 cessing methods to convert organic polymers into organic-inorganic hybrid 
 materials\, including developing the science to scale these processes for 
 manufacturing. Prof. Losego has over 70 peer-reviewed publications in lead
 ing scientific journals\, and his thermoelectric textile technology has be
 en externally licensed by Thermo-Flex Technologies for commercial developm
 ent. Prof. Losego received his B.S. degree from Penn State University and 
 his M.S. and Ph.D. from North Carolina State University\, all in materials
  science. Prior to joining the materials science and engineering faculty a
 t Georgia Tech in 2014\, he was a postdoctoral researcher at the Universit
 y of Illinois and a research faculty member in Chemical & Biomolecular Eng
 ineering at North Carolina State University.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gat

 \nShimeng Yu\nSchool of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Georgia Tec
 h\n\nAbstract: Neuro-inspired computing is a new computing paradigm that e
 mulates the neural network for information processing. To enable the large
 -scale neuromorphic system\, it is important to develop compact nanoscale 
 devices to support the synaptic and neuronal functions. In this talk\, I w
 ill discuss recent progress in this domain that integrates oxide based syn
 aptic and neuronal devices in neuromorphic hardware such as machine/deep l
 earning accelerators. First\, I will discuss the desired characteristics o
 f HfO2 based resistive synaptic devices (e.g. analog multilevel states\, w
 eight tuning linearity\, variation/noises) and NbO2 based oscillation neur
 on devices\, and show the principles of offline training and online traini
 ng. Next\, I will introduce the crossbar array architecture to efficiently
  implement the weighted sum and weight update operations that are commonly
  used in the machine/deep learning algorithms\, and show array-level exper
 imental demonstrations for these key operations. Lastly\, I will show our 
 recent work on doped HfO2 based ferroelectric transistor based synaptic ce
 ll design that overcomes the challenges to achieve high training accuracy 
 for online training.\n\nBio: Shimeng Yu is an associate professor of elect
 rical and computer engineering at Georgia Tech. He received the B.S. degre
 e in microelectronics from Peking University in 2009\, and the M.S. degree
  and Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University in 20
 11 and 2013\, respectively. From 2013 to 2018\, he was an assistant profes
 sor of electrical and computer engineering at Arizona State University. Pr
 of. Yu’s research interests are nanoelectronic devices and circuits for 
 energy-efficient computing systems. His expertise is on the emerging non-v
 olatile memories (e.g.\, RRAM\, ferroelectrics) for different applications
 \, such as machine/deep learning accelerator\, neuromorphic computing\, mo
 nolithic 3D integration\, and hardware security\, etc. Among Prof. Yu’s 
 honors\, he was a recipient of the DOD-DTRA Young Investigator Award in 20
 15\, the NSF Faculty Early CAREER Award in 2016\, the ASU Fulton Outstandi

 o Smart Supply Chains: Some Missing Pieces\nLeon McGinnis\n\nModern wareho
 uses\, factories and supply chains are becoming enormously complex systems
 . Historically\, the design and control of these systems has depended upon
  evolution and refinement over time to achieve high levels of performance.
  As a consequence\, we do not have the legacy of engineering design that i
 s found in digital circuits\, automobiles or airplanes. But that situation
  is changing\, albeit slowly. This talk will describe the changes that are
  taking place\, and what they mean for our research and teaching missions.

 \nThe Georgia Institute of Technology and Georgia State University are hos
 ting a one-day conference on implications of emerging technologies in terr
 orism. The goal of the event is to critically examine the following questi
 ons: How do disruptive and emerging technologies impact non-state actors? 
 Does the proliferation of new technologies change the dynamics of asymmetr
 ic warfare?\n\nThe conference will provide a forum where members of the mi
 litary and academic researchers can “bridge the gap” to develop strate
 gies in response to the possibility of terrorist groups acquiring new tech
 nologies. It will conclude with two keynote speakers\, Peter Singer [01] a
 nd Emerson T. Brooking [02]\, authors of LikeWar - The Weaponization of So
 cial Media.\n\nThere will be four panels with industry experts:\n\nDrones

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Postdoc
 \, Public\, Undergraduate students\nStatus: published\n\nThis symposium pr
 esents the current state-of-the-art of the Shape Machine\, a new computati
 onal\, visual and disruptive technology\, to leading experts in various fi
 elds including AI\, engineering\, computer science\, mathematics and desig
 n to review\, discuss\, and envision the field of shape cognition and comp
 uting at Georgia Tech.\n\nThe Shape Machine is a new computational technol
 ogy that fundamentally redefines the way shapes are represented\, indexed\
 , queried and operated upon. Its foregrounding of visual rules (shape rule
 s drawn in a 2D or 3D modeling system) over symbolic rules (instructions d
 efined in some programming language) provides a robust technology for engi
 neers\, computer scientists\, designers\, students and educators\, and in 
 general academics and professionals who use drawings and visual models to 
 develop and communicate their ideas.\n\nThe Shape Machine is currently dev
 eloped at the Shape Computation Lab at the School of Architecture\, Colleg
 e of Design\, in collaboration with the Schools of Mathematics and Interac
 tive Computing at the Colleges of Science and Computing at Georgia Institu
 te of Technology.\n\nRegister Here [1]\n\nProgram\n8:30 - 9:00 AM - Regist

 , Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\nStatus: published\n\nAbstract
 :\n\nThis talk explores the massive transformation taking place in US and 
 global healthcare now that EMRs are widely adopted and a practical API-bas
 ed interoperability framework is being broadly utilized by companies from 
 Google to Apple to Blue Cross and is being mandated by the federal governm
 ent. The ramifications are far reaching and offer promise of a safer\, mor
 e efficient and more effective care delivery system in part through the ac
 hievement of the long held goal of patient engagement in maintaining healt
 h and managing disease once it has developed. The FHIR standard is explain
 ed and its applications are illustrated through examples of cutting edge p
 roducts and research being done here at Georgia Tech\, Emory and elsewhere
 .\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\nAfter a long career in health informatics\, Dr. Braun
 stein has been a professor of the practice in the School of Interactive Co
 mputing for a decade. He developed Introduction to Health Informatics\, a 
 popular graduate seminar\, both on campus and as part of the OMSCS program
 . This talk is based on his latest book Health Informatics on FHIR: How HL
 7's New API is Transforming Healthcare (Springer\, 2018). He offers a popu
 lar free\, public MOOC on Coursera and will soon be posting an updated ver
 sion on edX. He is currently on leave working at CSIRO and the University 
 of Queensland in Brisbane on a novel application of health informatics to 
 medical education.\n\nHow to watch: If you can't make the event in person 
 you can Live Stream or watch the Recording (one week after event).\n\nLink

 \nThe Cybersecurity Lecture Series at Georgia Tech [1] is a free\, one-hou
 r lecture from a thought leader who is advancing the field of information 
 security and privacy. Invited speakers include executives and researchers 
 from Fortune 500 companies\, federal intelligence agencies\, start-ups\, a
 nd incubators\, as well as Georgia Tech faculty and students presenting th
 eir research. Lectures are open to all -- students\, faculty\, industry\, 
 government\, or simply the curious.\n\nRSVP [2]\n\nAbstract:\nVerifying th
 e identity claim of a caller is challenging to both enterprises and indivi
 duals. Blindly trusting the caller is not an option\; however\, building t
 rust is difficult because the caller’s phone number is easily spoofed an
 d the answers to knowledge-based questions are often available on the Inte
 rnet through historical data breaches and social media. Furthermore\, mobi
 le apps that prevent incoming spam/scam calls can fail to protect the user
  because the enterprise’s phone number spoofed by the caller cannot be b
 lacklisted. This talk will focus on the challenges of caller authenticatio
 n and how to use mobile devices to transfer the trust built in one channel
  (mobile app) to another (phone call).\n\nBio:\nTerry Nelms [3] is Directo
 r of Research at Pindrop where he leads a team of applied researchers solv
 ing challenging problems in fraud detection and authentication. Prior to j
 oining Pindrop\, he spent over a decade inventing\, designing and developi
 ng protection technologies at ISS\, IBM\, and Damballa. His research has p
 roduced new security products\, patents\, and publications in the top indu
 stry and academic conferences. He holds a B.S. and M.S. in Information Sys

 \, Public\, Undergraduate students\nStatus: published\n\nThe nation’s fu
 ture energy directions are being driven by decentralization and decarboniz
 ation. There has been an explosion in deployment of wind power and solar e
 nergy in the last five years\, to the extent that renewable power has beco
 me the largest new contributor to new electric power capacity. The decentr
 alized nature of these sources\, as well as their intermittent character\,
  is introducing many challenges to the electric grid. These trends\, coupl
 ed with growing electrification of transport and cybersecurity concerns\, 
 imply that changes are needed in how the grid is integrated with electrici
 ty users\, managed\, and controlled. This talk will describe a path forwar
 d for the future grid and discuss research to achieve a sustainable future
  for the use of energy\, based upon scenarios developed by the National Re
 newable Energy Laboratory.\n\n(Lunch reception immediately following semin

 \nThe 2019 Karlovitz Lecture and a Frontiers in Science Lecture to celebra
 te 2019\, the International Year of the Periodic Table\nThe 2019 Karlovitz
  Lecture will be delivered by best-selling author Sam Kean.\n\nKean's book
  about the periodic table\, "The Disappearing Spoon\," answers many uncomm
 on questions about chemical elements: Why did Gandhi hate iodine? Why did 
 the Japanese kill Godzilla with missiles made of cadmium? How did radium n
 early ruin Marie Curie’s reputation? And why did tellurium lead to the m
 ost bizarre gold rush in history?\n\nAccording to Kean\, the periodic tabl
 e is one of humanity’s crowning scientific achievements\, but it’s als
 o a treasure trove of passion\, adventure\, betrayal\, and obsession.\n\nA
 bout the Speaker\nBest-selling author Sam Kean’s book “The Disappearin
 g Spoon” delves into every element in the periodic table and explains ea
 ch one’s role in science\, money\, mythology\, war\, the arts\, medicine
 \, alchemy\, and other areas of human history\, from the Big Bang through 
 the end of time.\n\nIn addition to “The Disappearing Spoon\,” Sam Kean
  has several other titles on the New York Times bestselling list: “Caesa
 r’s Last Breath\,” “The Dueling Neurosurgeons\,” and “The Violin
 ist’s Thumb.” All of his books were named Amazon top science books of 
 the year. His work has been featured on NPR’s “Radiolab\,” “All Th
 ings Considered\,” and “Fresh Air.”\n\nSam Kean will sign books afte
 r the lecture.\nAbout the Karlovitz Lecture\nThe lecture is made possible 
 by an endowment in memory of College of Sciences Dean Les Karlovitz\, who 
 served as dean for 16 years until 1989. Seeking to broaden intellectual di
 scourse on campus\, the series focuses on speakers whose work has led them
  to stretch across disciplinary boundaries.\n\nAbout Frontiers in Science 
 Lectures\nLectures in this series are intended to inform\, engage\, and in
 spire students\, faculty\, staff\, and the public on developments\, breakt
 hroughs\, and topics of general interest in the sciences and mathematics. 
 Lecturers tailor their talks for nonexpert audiences.\n\nAbout the Periodi
 c Table Frontiers in Science Lecture Series\nThroughout 2019\, the College
  of Sciences will bring prominent researchers from Georgia Tech and beyond
  to expound on little-discussed aspects of chemical elements:\n\n- Feb. 6\
 , James Sowell\, How the Universe Made the Elements in the Periodic Table\

 \nThe Cybersecurity Lecture Series at Georgia Tech [1] is a free\, one-hou
 r lecture from a thought leader who is advancing the field of information 
 security and privacy. Invited speakers include executives and researchers 
 from Fortune 500 companies\, federal intelligence agencies\, start-ups\, a
 nd incubators\, as well as Georgia Tech faculty and students presenting th
 eir research. Lectures are open to all -- students\, faculty\, industry\, 
 government\, or simply the curious.\n\nRSVP [2]\n\nAbstract:\nRecently\, t
 he number of cyber threats to power systems has increased at an unpreceden
 ted rate. For instance\, the widespread blackout in Ukrainian power grid o
 n December 2015 was a wakeup call that modern power systems have numerous 
 vulnerabilities\, especially in power substations which form the backbone 
 of electricity networks. There have been significant efforts among researc
 hers to develop effective intrusion detection systems (IDSs) in order to p
 revent such attacks or at least reduce their damaging consequences. Howeve
 r\, all of the existing techniques require some level of trust from compon
 ents on the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) network\; hen
 ce\, they are still vulnerable to sophisticated attacks that can compromis
 e the SCADA system completely. In this talk\, we will introduce RFDIDS a r
 adio frequency-based distributed intrusion detection system for the power 
 grid which remains reliable even when the entire SCADA system is considere
 d untrusted. RFDIDS utilizes a radio receiver as a diagnostic tool to prov
 ide air-gapped\, independent\, and verifiable information about the radio 
 emissions from substation components\, particularly at low frequencies. Th
 e unique feature of RFDIDS is its robustness against replay/spoofing attac
 ks as its measured signal is encoded with the quasi-random distribution of
  the global lightning strokes.\n\nBio:\nTohid Shekari [3] received the BSc
  degree in electrical engineering from the Iran University of Science and 
 Technology\, Tehran\, Iran\, in 2013\, and the MSc degree in electrical en
 gineering from the University of Tehran\, Tehran\, in 2016. He is currentl
 y pursuing the Ph.D. degree in ECE and MSc in Cybersecurity with the Schoo
 l of Electrical and Computer Engineering\, Georgia Institute of Technology
 \, Atlanta\, GA\, USA. His current research interests include cybersecurit
 y in power systems\, intrusion detection in power substations\, power syst
 em resilience\, and power system operation. Mr. Shekari is a recipient of 
 the Best Paper Award in the Hawaii International Conference on System Scie
 nces (HICSS)\, 2018.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.edu/node/620189#0\n[

 ecules dispersed in aqueous media are ubiquitous since life began on Earth
  and continue to catalyze formulations of modern materials. A fundamental 
 understanding of the rich phenomenology on movements of charged macromolec
 ules in crowded environments continues to be elusive\, due to the long-ran
 ged nature of both the topological correlation from chain connectivity and
  electrostatic correlation from the charges in the system. Strong coupling
  among these long-ranged interactions results in a variety of rich behavio
 r unparalleled in uncharged systems. We will present recent advances on th
 e collective dynamics of charged macromolecules in solutions and hydrogels
 . In particular\, the “ordinary-extraordinary” dynamics\, single molec
 ule translocation through a protein channel under coupled forces\, and the
  newly discovered topologically frustrated non-diffusive dynamics of charg
 ed macromolecules inside charged hydrogels will be discussed.\n\nABOUT THE
  SPEAKER\n\nMurugappan Muthukumar received his Ph.D. in Chemical Physics a
 t the University of Chicago. After his postdoctoral fellowship in the Cave
 ndish Laboratory at the Cambridge University\, he joined the faculty of Il
 linois Institute of Technology for a couple of years\, and then moved to t
 he University of Massachusetts at Amherst\, where he is currently the Wilm
 er D. Barrett Distinguished Professor of Polymer Science and Engineering. 
 His current research topics of interest include polymer crystallization\, 
 polyelectrolyte physics\, and polymer translocation. Muthukumar is a Fello
 w of the American Physical Society\, and has received the Dillon Medal and
  the Polymer Physics Prize of the American Physical Society\, ACS Polymer 
 Chemistry Award\, Chancellor’s Medal of the University of Massachusetts\
 , and the Gutenberg Lecture Award from the University of Mainz. He is curr
 ently an Associate Editor of the Journal of Chemical Physics.\n\nLinks:\n[

 trengthening and Stability in Nanostructured Materials: A Computationally-
 Guided Approach\nGarritt Tucker - Assistant Professor Colorado School of M
 ines\n\nAbstract\n\nEngineering interest in nanostructuered materials has 
 been founded on the potential to improve a myriad of mechanical properties
  such as increased strength/hardness\, while scientific interest stems fro
 m the alternative fundamental mechanisms that are operative. Compared to t
 heir coarser-grained counterparts\, the influence of interfaces (i.e.\, gr
 ain boundaries) becomes more significant in nanostructured materials. Curr
 ent simulation techniques for understanding the mechanics in nanocrystalli
 ne alloys rely on non-physical microstructures\, first-order grain boundar
 y descriptors that poorly capture the complexity of interfacial structure-
 property relationships\, and a lack of quantitative approaches that can ac
 curately capture the specific contribution of different deformation mechan
 isms. In this study\, we propose utilizing higher-order descriptors to imp
 rove our understanding of interfacial-driven strengthening and stability. 
 These descriptors then aid in our boundary network modeling to understand 
 larger-scale polycrystalline behavior by unraveling the complexity surroun
 ding the competition/cooperation between different deformation mechanisms\
 , as a function of grain size. The contribution of interfaces and dislocat
 ion-mediated deformation to the total strain in the material is resolved v
 ia continuum-based kinematic metrics\, while the importance of choosing ph
 ysically-based atomistic microstructures and proper equilibration techniqu
 es is shown. By unraveling the mechanistic origins of strengthening and st
 ability in nanostructured materials\, we demonstrate how such a fundamenta
 l understanding might be leveraged for future inverse materials design str
 ategies.\n\nBiography\n\nProfessor Tucker joined the Mechanical Engineerin
 g Department at Mines in the summer of 2017 as an Assistant Professor and 
 is active in the interdisciplinary Materials Science program. Before joini
 ng the faculty at Mines\, he spent 4 years as an Assistant Professor in th
 e Department of Materials Science and Engineering at Drexel University (Ph
 iladelphia\, PA)\, and 2 years as a Postdoctoral Research Appointee at San
 dia National Laboratories (Albuquerque\, NM) in the Computational Material
 s and Data Science group. While at Drexel\, he was awarded the Outstanding
  Teacher Award in 2015 and the TMS Young Leader Professional Development A
 ward in 2016. Professor Tucker earned his Ph.D. in 2011 from the Georgia I
 nstitute of Technology (School of Materials Science and Engineering)\, and
  a B.S. in 2004 from Westminster College (Salt Lake City\, UT) majoring in
  both Physics and Mathematics. His research ambitions are aimed at integra
 ting high-performance computing\, materials theory\, and novel computation
 al tools to discover the fundamental structure-property relationships of e
 merging materials that will enable the predictive design of advanced mater
 ials with tunable properties.\n\nRefreshments will be served.\n\nLinks:\n[

  Electrocaloric-Based Regenerative Cooling\nJoe Mantese - Research Center 
 Fellow United Technologies Corporate Research Center\n\nAbstract:\n\nIt ha
 s been more than two decades since electrocaloric-based temperature lifts 
 of the order of 20°C were first reported in the ceramic materials and mor
 e than a decade since equivalent lifts were observed in polymeric thin fil
 ms. Yet\, since that time\, the demonstration of even a single high perfor
 mance electrocaloric-based cooling module has not been realized. Indeed\, 
 only modest performance (<5°C total lift) has been achieved when such mod
 ules have been challenged against a temperature incline. Coefficients of p
 erformance (COP) have been either unreported or inconsequential. Conversel
 y\, theoretical models predict the potential for regenerative cooling with
  lifts in excess of 10°C at COPs of ~6. In this talk we examine the cause
  of the shortfall in module performance from a material perspective. We di
 scuss: (1) The impact of performance parasitics. (2) Active area loss due 
 to dielectric breakdown and local arcing. (3) Degraded performance due to 
 stress concentration\, clamping from the electrode metallization and cycli
 c fatigue. Solutions to film and electrode failures can potentially be fou
 nd by using material engineering to improve electrical\, mechanical\, and 
 thermal-caloric properties.\n\nBiography:\n\nDr. Joseph Mantese is a Resea
 rch Fellow at United Technologies Corporate Research Center\, specializing
  in electronic/optical materials\, components\, sensors\, and actuators fo
 r aerospace and commercial system platforms\; with particular emphasis on

 ty for both signal and power. His work on embedded sensing is facilitated 
 by additive manufacturing\, MEMS\, and semiconductor fabrication processes
 . Dr. Mantese’ current responsibilities also include: future sensor and 
 functional material conception and development\, multi-business unit strat
 egic planning\, portfolio development\, and road mapping\; new program and
  project initiatives\; and business and government program development.\n\
 nPrior to joining UTRC\, Dr. Mantese was Department Head and Senior Fellow
  of Delphi Research Laboratories (Materials\, Components\, and Packaging) 
 the central research laboratory responsible for developing advanced techno
 logies for automotive systems\, including those for: safety\, entertainmen
 t\, HVAC\, connection systems\, and emissions control. Before joining Delp
 hi in 1999\, Dr. Mantese was a member of General Motors Research and Devel

 \nTackling the Cocktail Party Problem for Hearing Devices: Solutions\, Cha
 llenges and Opportunities\nAbstract. The cocktail party problem has remain
 ed to be one of the most challenging problems for hearing devices even aft
 er decades of extensive research. In this talk\, we will introduce and dis
 cuss our research on the multi-microphone speech enhancement with an empha
 sis on robust and practical real-time algorithms for hearing devices. We w
 ill first present our research on multiple-microphone speech enhancement u
 sing a microphone array alone. Secondly\, we will present our latest resea
 rch on the multimodal speech enhancement using both brain signals (i.e. EE
 G) and microphone signals in a single joint-optimization framework. In bot
 h cases\, we will use objective and subjective evaluation to demonstrate t
 he algorithms’ effectiveness. Finally\, we will discuss the challenges a
 nd opportunities in deploying these algorithms in the real-world.\n\nBiogr

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Postdoc\, Public\nExtras: F
 ree food\nStatus: published\n\nABSTRACT\n\nOne of the most important scien
 tific and technological frontiers of our time is the interfacing of electr
 onics with the human brain. This endeavour promises to help understand how
  the brain works and deliver new tools for diagnosis and treatment of path
 ologies including epilepsy and Parkinson’s disease. Current solutions\, 
 however\, are limited by the materials that are brought in contact with th
 e tissue and transduce signals across the biotic/abiotic interface. Recent
  advances in organic electronics have made available materials with a uniq
 ue combination of attractive properties\, including mechanical flexibility
 \, mixed ionic/electronic conduction\, enhanced biocompatibility\, and cap
 ability for drug delivery. I will present examples of novel devices for re
 cording and stimulation of neurons and show that organic electronic materi
 als offer tremendous opportunities to study the brain and treat its pathol
 ogies.\n\nABOUT THE SPEAKER\n\nGeorge Malliaras is the Prince Philip Profe
 ssor of Technology at the University of Cambridge. He received a PhD from 
 the University of Groningen and did a postdoc at the IBM Almaden Research 
 Center. Before joining Cambridge\, he was a faculty member at Ecole des Mi
 nes de St. Etienne and at Cornell University\, and served as the Director 
 of the Cornell NanoScale Facility. His research has been recognized with a
 wards from the New York Academy of Sciences\, the US National Science Foun
 dation\, and DuPont. He is a Fellow of the Materials Research Society and 
 of the Royal Society of Chemistry.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.edu/no

 put computing are very important tools in modern research and are essentia
 l to making meaningful process on many important problems.\n\nIn this semi
 nar\, lessons learned in the course of serving a large and vibrant computa
 tional research community is described. Examples of troubleshooting and op
 timization of serial and parallel programs are shown. In addition\, the us
 e of optimization and benchmarking is used to show how technical data can 
 be developed to guide users in determination of their research resource re
 quirements and use. An example of using containerization technology to ena
 ble a specialized software stack is also detailed. In conclusion\, some of
  the lessons learned and skills developed during the previous 4 years will
  be shared.\n\nBiography:\n\nDr. Christopher Blanton is an experienced HPC
  professional who has worked with some of the most exciting and innovative
  computational researchers.\n\nHe earned his Ph.D. from Syracuse Universit
 y in Computational and Theoretical Chemistry. During his studies\, he firs
 t became deeply interested in computational research and HPC. After gradua
 tion\, he joined the Pennsylvania State University's Institute for CyberSc
 ience. Dr. Blanton has worked most closely with members of the materials s
 cience community\, as a co-appointed staff member of the Materials Researc
 h Institute and the Institute for CyberScience as well as serving as an IC
 S Associate and member of the ICS Coordinating Committee. He looks forward

 embrane Biophysics\n\nAbstract:\n\nModern advanced computing has allowed s
 cientists to apply a “computational microscope” to numerous biological
  systems and uncover their physical underpinnings in a manner not feasible
  on smaller computing resources. This seminar will detail the use of super
 computers\, including XSEDE’s Bridges and D.E. Shaw Research’s Anton2\
 , both located at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center\, to conduct large-
 scale simulations of lipid bilayers. Why advanced computing resources were
  necessary will be discussed\, as will steps taken to maximize the computa
 tional efficiency of these simulations.\n\nThis approach\, at the nexus of
  computational science\, physics\, chemistry\, and biology\, may be employ
 ed to understand the behavior of cell membranes\, the lipid bilayers that 
 form the boundary of living cells and control their interaction with the s
 urrounding world. Lipid rafts\, regions of the membrane with distinct phys
 ical properties\, may be modeled in a system of coexisting liquid phases a
 nd simulated by Molecular Dynamics. Extracting lipid physical properties f
 rom the studies’ numerical data revealed new insights into coupling of l
 ipid rafts and communication across the membrane.\n\nBiography:\n\nDr. Mic
 hael Weiner received his undergraduate degree in physics from Yale Univers
 ity and his doctorate\, also in physics\, from Cornell University. He comp
 leted his doctoral research in computational biophysics in the laboratory 
 of Gerald Feigenson\, where he focused on Molecular Dynamics simulations o
 f the biophysical chemistry of lipid bilayers as models of cell membranes.
  Dr. Weiner is interested applying advanced computing techniques to questi
 ons throughout the sciences.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.edu/node/621

 \nBiomaterials-based Optical Metabolite Sensing\n\nFriday June 21st\, 2019
  Noon-1pm\; Room 3029 3rd Floor Krone EBB (with Pizza)\nProfessor Mike McS
 hane\, Department Head\, Biomedical Engineering\, Texas A&M University\nPe
 rsonal health monitoring is becoming increasingly accessible as the ease o
 f producing low-cost\, low-power embedded systems has fueled a rapid growt
 h in consumer products aimed at “measuring me.” Yet\, a major technolo
 gy gap is in the space of continuous chemical sensing. The majority of thi
 s talk will focus on describing our materials-focused solutions and relate
 d optical instrumentation aimed at closing this gap\; it will also describ
 e examples of how the same technology is being applied to various other ap
 plications\, particularly bioreactors for cell manufacturing to and tumor-
 egg models. Our research emphasis has been towards developing miniature\, 
 injectable biosensor implants with microscale and nanoscale organization t
 o enable observation of interstitial biochemistry. These materials provide
  specificity through use of various receptors and enhance sensitivity thro
 ugh optical amplification by phosphorescence or Raman scattering. Further\
 , they employ materials that can integrate naturally with tissue\, such as
  porous gels\, enhancing prospects for accurate\, rapid response and long-
 term monitoring. These studies pave the way for modular sensing systems ba
 sed on sensing microdomains embedded in hydrogels\; the former serve as th
 e selective responsive elements whereas the latter act to immobilize the s
 ensing domains while providing a “friendly” surface to interface with 
 the body. Prototype miniaturized\, dedicated instrumentation to interrogat
 e the implants will also be discussed. Examples of current and potential t
 ranslational activities will be provided and some major remaining challeng
 es to long-term in vitro and in vivo biochemical monitoring will be highli
 ghted.\n\nDr. Mike McShane is James J. Cain Professor II in Biomedical Eng
 ineering at Texas A&M University\, where he serves as Department Head and 
 is also affiliated with Materials Science & Engineering and the Center for
  Remote Health Technologies and Systems. Prof McShane’s primary research
  interests are in biomedical instrumentation and optics\, biosensor techno
 logy\, and biomaterials with emphasis on micro/nanofabrication for respons
 ive materials. In this work\, he has pioneered the use of micro/nanopartic
 les\, capsules\, and hydrogel-particle composites for development of optic
 al biosensing systems and has assisted in commercialization of related pro
 ducts. Professor McShane is a fellow of AIMBE and is a Senior Member of SP
 IE and also IEEE\, for which he has served in numerous elected and appoint
 ed leadership positions including his current role as Past-President of th
 e IEEE Sensors Council.\n\nPizza and Drinks Will be Provided\n\nHost: Shui

 \n\nEarly registration is open for REU students until May 31. Ask your REU
  adviser for the registration link.\n\nThe College of Sciences and iGniTe 
 Summer Launch Program present "Halloween in June\," a costume party and va
 riety show to celebrate the International Year of the Periodic Table of Ch
 emical Elements.\n\nCome in your best costumes inspired by the periodic ta
 ble or chemical elements. Winners of various categories will receive fabul
 ous prizes.\n\nPulsate to the science rock music of Leucine Zipper and the
  Zinc Fingers (LZZF)\nPunk-rock music and science share similar goals—to
  go boldly (loudly?) where no person has gone before. Leucine Zipper and T
 he Zinc Fingers (LZZF) amalgamate music and science as a synthetic cross-d
 isciplinary project to bring science to the people in a decidedly original
  medium.\n\nThis ain’t your typical outreach education or NSF broader-im
 pacts initiative. This is loud-and-proud and scientifically sound rock and
  roll! LZZF performs original rock songs\, and a few select cover-songs\, 
 that are ALL ABOUT SCIENCE! Their songs feature biofilms\, enzymes\, dinos
 aurs\, entropy\, social insects\, and more.\n\nActual scientists (three of
  four are Georgia Tech faculty) and life-long punk rockers compose the ban
 d\, so you can be sure that the lyrics are scientifically valid\, and the 
 tunes are rabidly arousing. See them live and enjoy the spectacle of Earth
 's first genetically modified rock band!\n\nThe band has performed around 
 Atlanta since 2014 and released their first album Atomic Anarchy\, to grea
 t critical acclaim\, in 2018.\n\nThe band’s sound calls to mind the Ramo
 nes\, Joan Jett\, Kiss\, or Iggy Pop. That is\, if those icons wrote songs
  about enzymes… – Carmen Drahl\, Chemical and Engineering News [1]\, 9
 /30/2018\n\nAnd as if the second song on their debut CD Atomic Anarchy\, 
 “We’re a Science Band” didn’t make it clear enough\, their songs a
 re all sort of about science\, and science accessories. But they sure don
 ’t sound like they were cooked up in a sterile lab. Nah\, they kick it o
 ut like they’ve spent years honing their three chords in garages and bas
 ements like all good bands do\, with an uncomplicated\, Ramones-worthy\, g
 et in/get out\, old school punk style.” – Jeff Clark\, Stomp and Stamm
 er [2]\, 10/4/2018\n\nWallow in the dirty science of "Carbon and Cubic Fec
 es" with David Hu\nDavid Hu is an IgNobel Prize winner\, mechanical engine
 ering professor at Georgia Tech\, and author of "How to Walk on Water and 
 Climb Up Walls: Animal Movement and the Robots of the Future."\n\nHuman wa
 ste has substantial resource value: human urine contains phosphorus\, pota
 ssium\, nitrogen\; and human feces contains mostly carbon. David will talk
  about the physics of excretion. In the law of urination\, he will show th
 at animals urinate for a constant duration\, independent of body mass. In 
 their study of cubic feces of the wombat\, he will show how soft intestine
 s can form corners in feces.\n\nLaugh out loud with Lew Lefton's science h
 umor\nLew Lefton is a faculty member in the Georgia Tech School of Mathema
 tics\, the assistant dean of information technology for the Georgia Tech C
 ollege of Sciences\, and associate vice president for research computing a
 t Georgia Tech. With so many roles\, he is a very important person.\n\nBut
  Lew is not just your ordinary VIP or computing/mathematics geek. He's an 
 accomplished and experienced comedian who has done stand up and improv com
 edy with a geeky twist for over 30 years. His unique talents are best summ
 ed up by his business card\, which reads: Lew Lefton\, Mathematician/Comed
 ian\, "He's funny and he can prove it."\n\nMarvel at magic card trick and 
 treats by Matt Baker\nMatt Baker is an internationally renowned Georgia Te
 ch mathematics professor by day and an accomplished magician [3] by night.
  Matt currently serves as associate dean for faculty development in the Ge
 orgia Tech College of Sciences.\n\nAs a magician Matt has performed three 
 times at the invitation-only Fechter’s Finger Flicking Frolic [4]\, the 
 world’s premiere close-up magic convention. In 2018 he recorded a Pengui
 n Live Acts show and lecture in Columbus\, Ohio\, and spent four days in S
 pain studying with Juan Tamariz [5]\, the world’s greatest living close-
 up magician. In July 2019\, Matt will be lecturing at the International Br
 otherhood of Magicians Annual Convention [6] in Scottsdale\, Arizona.\n\nM
 att’s awards for magic include the Atlanta Society of Magicians' Top Dog
  Award and the Greater Atlanta Magician of the Year award.\n\nMatt's magic
  tricks have appeared in several national periodicals. He just published h
 is first book of original magic\, " The Buena Vista Shuffle Club [7]." Wor
 ld-renowned magician Joshua Jay [8] calls it "an excellent\, funny\, and p
 ersonal collection of magic that is a joy to read".\n\nPlus periodic table

 ating micron sized objects in magnetic liquids in a continuous flow throug
 h so-called “ferrohydrodynamics” is a relatively new research field. I
 t has resulted in label-free manipulation techniques in microfluidic syste
 ms and exciting applications such as circulating tumor cells (CTCs) enrich
 ment. It is the goal of this talk to introduce the fundamental principles 
 of ferrohydrodynamics and its recent applications in microfluidic enrichme
 nt of CTCs developed in my lab. The theoretical background of two commonly
  used specificities of manipulation in magnetic liquids will be discussed\
 , including the size and contrast of magnetic property. Pros and cons of c
 ommonly used media of magnetic liquids including paramagnetic salt solutio
 ns and ferrofluids will be introduced. Details of CTCs enrichment applicat
 ion will also be discussed.\n\nBiography: Leidong Mao is a Professor in th
 e School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Georg
 ia in Athens\, GA. He received his PhD in electrical engineering from Yale
  University. He is interested in developing new microfluidic technologies 
 for biological or biomedical applications such as cancer cell isolation an

SUMMARY:Introversion as an Ally workshop with Neith Sankofa

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\nStatus: published\n\nThe Web
  of Brilliance ERG and Institute Diversity present the workshop "Introvers
 ion as an Ally\," with Neith Sankofa.\n\nInteracting with leaders and infl
 uencers across many social and cultural lines is a marker of a seasoned pr
 ofessional. Being able to be present\, flexible and “in-the-moment” wh
 ile doing so is a marker of a fully empowered\, exceptional professional.\
 n\nBut what happens when there are challenges… like being an introvert? 
 It begins with recognizing introversion as an ally to the type of insights
  that create full empowerment because of an introvert’s innate ability t
 o be or become internally aware.\n\nIn this workshop participants will rec
 ognize when they (and others) have switched to “automatic” in their in
 teractions. Through integration exercises\, participants will uncover how 
 to counterbalance the tendency to fall into unconscious role-playing (due 
 to the stress of introversion) by authentically engaging their target audi
 ences for maximum success. By getting in touch with what they need and fee
 l\, and creating a toolkit for counterbalancing\, they will begin to creat
 e more ideal conditions for themselves in any situation through expanded i
 nternal awareness.\n\nFree and open to Georgia Tech Staff and Faculty\, bu
 t seats are very limited. You must register to attend.\n\nRefreshments pro
 vided. Introverts\, Extroverts\, and everyone in between are welcome.\n\nR

 \, Public\, Undergraduate students\nStatus: published\n\nPlease join the R
 ay C. Anderson Center for Sustainable Business [1] at the Scheller College
  of Business and the Georgia Tech College of Sciences [2] to the Carbon Re
 duction Challenge Poster Presentation!\n\nWith support from the Ray C. And
 erson Foundation NextGen Fund [3] and the Sheth Foundation [4]\, Professor
 s Kim Cobb and Beril Toktay collaborated to expand Professor Cobb’s succ
 essful Carbon Reduction Challenge class to enable students participating i
 n an internship or co-op to plan and implement a carbon reduction project 
 with their employers. Individual students or a team took the initiative to
  identify and execute a plan that reduces their employer’s carbon emissi
 ons\, most often saving their employer money\, over the course of their in
 ternship. Project examples from the class range from creating employee cha
 llenges to reduce their personal carbon emissions\, to changes in building
  lighting schedules\, to more capital-intensive projects such as HVAC modi
 fications.\n\nThe winners of the Carbon Reduction Challenge will be decide
 d based on i) the amount of carbon emissions avoided (whether actual or po
 tential)\, and ii) the level of awareness fostered through the project. Th
 e winning team(s) will be announced at the conclusion of the Finalist Post
 er Expo and awarded cash prizes for their work. First prize is $5\,000\, s
 econd place is $3\,000 and third place is $1\,000.\n\nRead more about the

 Near-Field Integrated Magnetic Sensing System for Hardware Security\n\nSpe
 aker: Professor Mai-Khanh N. Nguyen\, VLSI Design and Education Center (VD
 EC)\, The University of Tokyo\, JAPAN\n\nAbstract: Hardware Trojan or spyw
 are circuits operating as hardware backdoors can be implemented and integr
 ated into computer chips\, smart-cards\, and other crypto processors. Hard
 ware Trojan circuits inside a chip is generally harmless in normal operati
 on until they get triggered by a preset internal or external signal to ste
 al data or override and even control the system. Detection of hardware Tro
 jans is very difficult as they are normally in nano-scale sizes and integr
 ated into ICs with high complexity system inside and a huge number of gate
 s. Therefore\, Trojan inspection through destructive reverse engineering m
 ay not ensure the absence of hardware Trojans. In this talk\, I present a 
 demonstration to non-invasively detect hardware Trojan\, analyze and ident
 ify vulnerable portions of cryptographic chips based on magnetic sensing t
 owards cybersecurity applications.\n\nSpeaker Bio: Dr. Mai-Khanh is curren
 tly is an assistant professor at VLSI Design and Education Center (VDEC)\,

 ize with other international students! This event is followed by multiple 
 informational sessions (see below!)\n\nHow to Succeed as an F-1/J-1 Intern
 ational Student (In-person Session)\n\nF-1 & J-1 students are required to 
 comply with many immigration regulations. Violation of these regulations c
 ould greatly impact a student’s ability to succeed academically. Student
 s in attendance will learn about enrollment requirements\, travel issues\,
  employment in the U.S.\, and other relevant topics.\n\nStaying Safe and H
 ealthy in the U.S.\n\nThe GT Police Department will discuss a variety of t
 opics including: the rights of an international student\, what to do in an
  emergency\, and services offered by the GT police department to keep stud
 ents safe. In addition\, students will hear about Georgia Tech medical and
  counseling services\, how the GT medical insurance plan works\, and what 
 additional services are offered to international students to assist them a
 s they adjust to life in the United States.\n\nWelcome to America: USA/Geo
 rgia Tech 101\n\nThis session is a "crash course" on the U.S. and Georgia 
 Tech. Topics covered include: obtaining a driver's license\, using public 
 transportation\, applying for a Social Security card\, and getting a cell 
 phone. The Student Alumni Association will also be in attendance to teach 
 students about GA Tech’s history and traditions. You are encouraged to w
 atch these videos [1] to get the most out of this session!\n\nAMIS Lunch &
  Presentation\n\nLearn about different opportunities AMIS (Atlanta Ministr
 y with International Students) has to help you engage in the Atlanta commu
 nity and learn about AMIGO\, their buddy program!\n\nCultural Transitions 
 & Student Panel\n\nThe U.S. academic system is different than systems arou
 nd the world. An understanding of these differences and knowledge of campu
 s resources is essential to academic success. Watch OIE’s Academic Trans
 itions videos to get acquainted with U.S. higher education. Watch these th

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Postdoc
 \, Public\, Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\nStatus: draft\n\nGl
 en Evenbly\nSchool of Physics\, Georgia Tech\nAbstract: Quantum many-body 
 systems are difficult to study because the space of possible many-body sta
 tes is huge: its dimension grows exponentially in the system size. However
 \, thanks to quantum information theory\, progress in understanding the ro
 le of entanglement in quantum many-body systems has revealed that only a s
 mall region of this huge state space is needed for describing relevant qua
 ntum states. Tensor networks\, originally developed in the context of cond
 ensed-matter physics and based on renormalization group ideas\, exploit th
 is understanding of entanglement in order to provide efficient description
 s of many-body quantum states. In this talk I will (i) review our current 
 understanding of many-body entanglement\, (ii) introduce tensor networks a
 s tools for the study of many body systems\, and (iii) give an overview of
  the exciting developments within the tensor network program.\n\nBio: Glen
  Evenbly received the PhD degree in physics from the University of Queensl
 and\, Australia in 2010. His research focuses on the development of novel 
 theoretical and numerical tools for modelling entanglement in quantum syst
 ems. He joined Caltech in 2011 as the Sherman-Fairchild Prize postdoctoral
  fellow and UC Irvine in 2014 as a Simons Foundation postdoctoral fellow\,
  where he continued his work on quantum information and many-bodyphysics. 
 He joined the faculty at the University of Sherbrooke\, Canada in 2016 bef
 ore joining the School of Physics at Georgia Tech in 2019. Glen received t
 he IUPAP Young Scientist Prize in Computational Physics in 2017 for his ex
 ceptional work on developing the tensor network formalism.\n\nLight refres
 hments will be served.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.edu/node/624204#0

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Public\, Undergraduate stud
 ents\nStatus: published\n\nSpeaker: Professor Chien-Chung Lin\, National C
 hiao-Tung University & ITRI\, Taiwan\n\nAbstract:\n\nColloidal Quantum Dot
 s (CQDs) have been working their ways into the next-generation photonic de
 vices. Highly efficient light emitters and absorbers made of CQDs can be d
 emonstrated among various types of materials including CdSe/CdS/CdTe and p
 erovskites. The wavelength tunability\, according to their physical sizes\
 , can be readily suitable for LED displays and solar spectrum management p
 urposes. Meanwhile\, the reliability of these nanocrystals remains one of 
 the most important issues before their full-scale commercialization. In th
 is talk\, we will present our latest work on the improvement of the reliab
 ility of hybrid CQD photonic devices. A brief review on previous achieveme
 nts will also be provided. The compact package and long lifetime features 
 will be the key factors for future successful deployment of such materials
  and devices.\n\nSpeaker's Biography:\n\nDr. Chien-Chung Lin was born in T
 aipei\, Taiwan\, in 1970. He received his B.S.E.E. degree from National Ta
 iwan University\, Taipei\, in 1993\, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in ele
 ctrical engineering from Stanford University\, Stanford\, CA\, USA\, in 19
 97 and 2002\, respectively. His thesis work focused on design\, modeling\,
  and fabrication of micromachined-tunable optoelectronic devices. He joine
 d E2O Communications Inc.\, Calabasas\, CA\, USA\, as a Senior Optoelectro
 nic Engineer in 2002. His main research interests then were in optically a
 nd electrically pumped long-wavelength vertical cavity surface emitting la
 sers. In 2004\, he joined Santur Corporation\, Fremont\, CA\, where he ini
 tially worked as a member of technical staff and became a Manager of Laser
  Chip Engineering later. He had worked on monolithic multi-wavelength DFB 
 Laser arrays for data and telecommunications\, yield and reliability analy
 sis of DFB Laser arrays\, etc. In2009\, he joined the National Chiao Tung 
 University (NCTU) in Tainan\, Taiwan\, where he currently holds the positi
 on of a full Professor. His major research interests are in the design and
  fabrication of novel semiconductor optoelectronic devices\, including LED
 s\, solar cells\, and lasers. Since 2016\, he has been jointly appointed b
 y the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI)\, where he participa
 tes in and leads several key projects in micro-LEDs\, 3D ICs\, and silicon
  photonics. Prof. Lin has published more than 200 journal and conference p
 apers and is a senior member of the IEEE and the Optical Society of Americ
 a.\n\n(Pizzas will be served after the seminar presentation)\n\nLinks:\n[0

 ls Processing Fundamentals for the Self-Aligned Capillarity Assisted Litho
 graphy for Electronics (SCALE) Process Lorraine F. Francis - Professor and
  3M Chair in Experiential Learning University of Minnesota Department of C
 EMS\n\nAbstract:\n\nApplications for circuits and devices printed on flexi
 ble substrates abound\, ranging from wearable diagnostic sensors to large 
 area\, roll-up displays. Continuous printing processes are attractive for 
 manufacturing flexible electronics. However\, two challenges typically ari
 se in this pursuit: (1) creating small feature sizes\, and (2) achieving r
 egistration of multiple functional layers. This presentation will cover ou
 r efforts to address these challenges using a new approach – Self-Aligne
 d Capillarity-Assisted Lithography for Electronics (or SCALE). SCALE invol
 ves imprinting a multilevel open network of reservoirs\, capillaries and d
 evice structures into a UV-curable coating deposited on a flexible substra
 te\, delivering electronically functional inks into the reservoirs by inkj
 et printing\, and using capillarity to selectively fill capillaries and de
 vice structures attached to the reservoirs. The single imprint step create
 s all the structural features needed in the devices and capillary flow cre
 ates self-aligned\, multimaterial devices. To-date we have used SCALE to c
 reate conductive networks\, resistors\, capacitors\, diodes and transistor
 s. This presentation will show advances in device architecture and perform
 ance\, and explore the key processing steps. Special attention will be giv
 en to the continuous roll-to-roll imprinting process\, experiments and vis
 ualizations of liquid flow in open capillary channels\, and unique flow co
 ntrol methods such as a microfluidic diode.\n\nBiography:\n\nLorraine F. F
 rancis is Professor of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science and curr
 ently holds the 3M Chair in Experiential Learning in the College of Scienc
 e and Engineering at the University of Minnesota. She received a B.S. in C
 eramic Engineering from Alfred University in 1985\, and M.S. and Ph.D. in 
 Ceramic Engineering from the University of Illinois in 1987 and 1990\, res
 pectively. She then joined the University of Minnesota. Professor Francis 
 has research interests broadly in the area of materials processing\, inclu
 ding coating and printing processes and microstructure development studies
 . She is also very involved in undergraduate education\, including develop
 ing a project-based learning class for freshmen and authoring a textbook. 
 Professor Francis has received several awards. In 2019\, she was named Col
 lege of Science and Engineering Distinguished Professor\, and in 2014 she 
 received the Horace T. Morse - University of Minnesota Alumni Association 
 Award for Outstanding Contributions to Undergraduate Education.\n\nRecepti

 \nMadhavan Swaminathan\nJohn Pippin Chair in Microsystems Packaging & Elec
 tromagnetics\nSchool of Electrical and Computer Engingeering\nAbstact: A c
 ombination of "Moore" (IC) and "More than Moore" (package) scaling has led
  to the shrinking of electronic systems over the last several decades. As 
 scaling continues beyond CMOS to include advanced devices\, scaling of the
  package needs to continue to enable system scaling\, leading to the integ
 ration and miniaturization of systems. This requires new technologies for 
 package integration which when connected to assembled ICs leads to System 
 on Package (SoP) solutions that have superior performance and size as comp
 ared to current technologies. This presentation will discuss advanced SoP 
 platforms for integration with a focus on heterogeneity for a variety of a
 pplications that include AI\, HPC\, Power Electronics\, mmWave to name a f
 ew. The inter-disciplinary nature of the research will be highlighted base
 d on faculty interactions between four different schools at GT.\n\nBio: Ma

 udying CNS delivery systems\n\nABSTRACT\nThe central nervous system (CNS) 
 has a specialized vascular barrier\, the blood-brain barrier (BBB)\, which
  possesses a highly selective barrier function that restricts the permeabi
 lity of drugs\, leading to a high failure rate in the development of CNS t
 herapeutics. However\, it remains difficult with existing in vivo models t
 o conduct mechanistic studies of the barrier function and interactions wit
 h drugs at molecular and cellular levels. This challenge highlights the im
 portance of the development of in vitro models that mimic the physiologica
 l structure and function of the BBB. Despite various efforts\, physiologic
 ally relevant in vitro human BBB models capable of highly precise\, quanti
 tative analysis of drug delivery remain to be developed. In this study\, w
 e present a human BBB-on-a-chip designed to create a 3D astrocytic network
  with reduced reactive gliosis and polarized aquaporin-4\, critical featur
 es of the BBB that has yet to be demonstrated. Our model will provide a re
 liable tool for studying the penetrance of CNS drugs across the BBB.\n\nBI

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Public\
 , Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\nStatus: published\n\nAbstract
 :\n\nWe have witnessed tremendous growth in Artificial Intelligence (AI) a
 nd machine learning (ML) recently. However\, research shows that AI and ML
  models are often vulnerable to adversarial attacks\, and their prediction
 s can be difficult to understand\, evaluate and ultimately act upon.\n\nDi
 scovering real-world vulnerabilities of deep neural networks and counterme
 asures to mitigate such threats has become essential to successful deploym
 ent of AI in security settings. We present our joint works with Intel whic
 h include the first targeted physical adversarial attack (ShapeShifter) th
 at fools state-of-the-art object detectors\; a fast defense (SHIELD) that 
 removes digital adversarial noise by stochastic data compression\; and int
 eractive systems (ADAGIO and MLsploit) that further democratize the study 
 of adversarial machine learning and facilitate real-time experimentation f
 or deep learning practitioners.\n\nFinally\, we also present how scalable 
 interactive visualization can be used to amplify people’s ability to und
 erstand and interact with large-scale data and complex models. We sample f
 rom projects where interactive visualization has provided key leaps of ins
 ight\, from increased model interpretability (Gamut with Microsoft Researc
 h)\, to model explorability with models trained on millions of instances (
 ActiVis deployed with Facebook)\, increased usability for non-experts abou
 t state-of-the-art AI (GAN Lab open-sourced with Google Brain\; went viral
 !)\, and our latest work Summit\, an interactive system that scalably summ
 arizes and visualizes what features a deep learning model has learned and 
 how those features interact to make predictions. We conclude by highlighti
 ng the next visual analytics research frontiers in AI.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\n
 Polo Chau is an Associate Professor of Computing at Georgia Tech. He co-di
 rects Georgia Tech's MS Analytics program. His research group bridges mach
 ine learning and visualization to synthesize scalable interactive tools fo
 r making sense of massive datasets\, interpreting complex AI models\, and 
 solving real world problems in cybersecurity\, human-centered AI\, graph v
 isualization and mining\, and social good. His Ph.D. in Machine Learning f
 rom Carnegie Mellon University won CMU's Computer Science Dissertation Awa
 rd\, Honorable Mention. He received awards and grants from NSF\, NIH\, NAS
 A\, DARPA\, Intel (Intel Outstanding Researcher)\, Symantec\, Google\, Nvi
 dia\, IBM\, Yahoo\, Amazon\, Microsoft\, eBay\, LexisNexis\; Raytheon Facu
 lty Fellowship\; Edenfield Faculty Fellowship\; Outstanding Junior Faculty

 tudent papers at SDM'14 and KDD'16 (runner-up)\; Best demo at SIGMOD'17 (r
 unner-up)\; Chinese CHI'18 Best paper. His research led to open-sourced or
  deployed technologies by Intel (for ISTC-ARSA: ShapeShifter\, SHIELD\, AD
 AGIO\, MLsploit)\, Google\, Facebook\, Symantec (Polonium\, AESOP protect 
 120M people from malware)\, and Atlanta Fire Rescue Department. His securi

 eness of the impact of implicit bias and facilitate equitable decision-mak
 ing across myriad processes related to faculty evaluations. As a participa
 nt in the workshop\, you will learn the following:\n\n• An introduction 
 to the concept of implicit bias and how these unconscious\, automatic ment
 al processes may impact behaviors such as evaluating candidates during fac
 ulty search and/or RPT processes.\n\n• Empirical research on vitaes\, le
 tters of recommendations\, and teaching evaluations to illustrate the impa
 ct of implicit bias on decisions.\n\n• Effective practices and strategie
 s for faculty search and RPT committees.\n\nThese workshops will be facili
 tated by Julie Ancis\, associate vice president\, Institute Diversity\; Pa

SUMMARY:GVU Center Brown Bag: Richard DeMillo "Usability\, Privacy\, Cyber

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Public\
 , Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\nStatus: published\n\nAbstract
 :\n\nAll modern public elections in the United States use computers called
  voting machines to automate at least part of the voting process. Like all
  computers\, voting machines can be misprogrammed\, misconfigured\, misuse
 d and hacked. Poorly secured data\, open networks\, and aging computing eq
 uipment with known vulnerabilities to malware are all subject to attack. T
 here is substantial evidence that foreign adversaries have infiltrated Ame
 rican election systems and there is growing evidence that election results
  were affected. Federal agencies\, the Intelligence Community\, and congre
 ssional committees all agree that action is required. This talk will focus
  on the unique aspects of elections from a computing standpoint: (1) Why a
 re there not national standards? (2) What cybersecurity tools would make e
 lections more secure? (3) How does the right to a secret ballot affect ele
 ction technology? (4) What is the future of electronic voting in the state
  of Georgia?\n\nIn this talk I will pay special attention to usability and
  privacy problems and point out areas in which improved understanding of c
 ognitive limitations of voters can influence public policy. This work is b
 ased in part on a recent paper entitled “Ballot Marking Devices (BMDs) c
 annot assure the will of the voters\,” by Philip Stark\, Andrew Appel\, 
 and me. This paper can be downloaded here: [1]\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\nRichard 
 DeMillo is the Charlotte B. and Roger C. Warren Professor of Computing and
  Professor of Management\, former John P. Imlay Dean of Computing\, and Di
 rector of the Center for 21st Century Universities at the Georgia Institut
 e of Technology. Author of over 100 articles\, books\, and patents\, he ha
 s held academic positions at Purdue University\, the University of Wiscons
 in\, and the University of Padua. He directed the Computer and Computation
  Research Division of the National Science Foundation and was Hewlett-Pack
 ard's first Chief Technology Officer. He is the 2013 Lumina Foundation Ina
 ugural Fellow which recognized his founding of the Center for 21st Century
  Universities as a “unique institution.” He is also a Fellow of both t
 he American Association for the Advancement of Science and the Association
  for Computing Machinery. He is the author of the influential 2011 book 
 “Abelard to Apple: The Fate of American Colleges and Universities” and
  an award-winning 2015 sequel entitled “Revolution in Higher Education: 
 How a Small Band of Innovators will Make College Accessible and Affordable

 of the Lyndon House Arts Center and artists Samuel Stabler\, Kalina Wińsk
 a\, and Matt Haffner as they talk about their inspiration and processes fo
 r the works included in the exhibit.\n\nThe reception begins at 6pm\, and 
 the artist talks will start at 7pm. This event is free and open to the pub
 lic.\n\nDidi Dunphy\, exhibit curator\, traveled across Georgia to select 
 contemporary artists to participate. Cut and Paste: Works of Paper examine
 s ways in which working artists manipulate paper to create remarkable and 
 varied works of art. She will lead a conversation with three of the eleven
  artists included in the exhibit\, discussing inspiration\, technique\, an
 d experiences.\n\nThroughout Samuel Stabler’s career\, he has worked and
  re-worked found images. His cut paper works in the exhibit are inspired b
 y sources ranging from the Old Masters to contemporary pop culture. [1]\n\
 nKalina Wińska is an associate professor at Valdosta State University. He
 r mixed-media drawings on paper are inspired by weather analysis: essentia
 lly “abstracted snapshots of cloudscapes visibly marked with human activ
 ity.” [2]\n\nAtlanta-based Matt Haffner is a photographer and mixed-medi
 a and installation artist. Haffner’s works included in the exhibit are m
 ade from humble materials that “are an exercise in simplicity and nuance

 \nIgor Bargatin\nUniv. of Pennsylvania\, Mechanical Engineering and Applie
 d Mechanics\nAbstract: Recently\, we introduced the concept of plate mecha
 nical metamaterials—cellular plates with carefully controlled periodic g
 eometry and unique mechanical properties—as well as its initial realizat
 ion in the form of freestanding corrugated plates made out of an ultrathin
  film. We used atomic layer deposition (ALD) and microfabrication techniqu
 es to make robust plates out of a single continuous ALD layer with cm-scal
 e lateral dimensions and thicknesses between 25 and 100 nm\, creating the 
 thinnest freestanding plates that can be picked up by hand. We also fabric
 ated and characterized nanocardboard - plate metamaterials made from multi
 ple layers of nanoscale thickness\, whose geometry and properties are remi
 niscent of honeycomb sandwich plates or corrugated paper cardboard. Ultral
 ow weight\, mechanical robustness\, thermal insulation\, as well as chemic
 al and thermal stability of alumina make plate metamaterials attractive fo
 r numerous applications\, including structural elements in flying microrob
 ots and interstellar light sails\, high-temperature thermal insulation in 
 energy converters\, photophoretic levitation\, as well as ultrathin sensor
 s and resonators. I will briefly discuss our experimental progress on all 
 these applications\, including demonstrations of extremely robust thermal 
 insulators that can sustain a temperature difference of ~1000 K across a m
 icron-scale gap\, hollow AFM cantilevers that offer greatly enhanced sensi
 tivity and data acquisition rates\, and macroscopic plates that levitate w
 hen illuminated by light.\n\nBio: Igor Bargatin received his undergraduate
  degree in theoretical physics from the Lomonosov Moscow State University\
 , and a Ph.D. degree in physics and electrical engineering from the Califo
 rnia Institute of Technology\, Pasadena. After postdoctoral appointments a
 t LETI/Minatec (Grenoble\, France) and Stanford University\, he became the
  Class of 1965 Term Assistant Professor in the Department of Mechanical En
 gineering and Applied Mechanics (MEAM)\, University of Pennsylvania. Prof.
  Bargatin’s research interests are focused on micro- and nanomechanical 
 structures for new applications in energy conversion\, ultra-lightweight m
 aterials\, and new mechanisms of levitation. He is a recent recipient of t
 he NSF CAREER award and the Penn Engineering teaching award.\n\nLinks:\n[0

 ysis\n\nAtom Probe Tomography (APT) is the highest special resolution anal
 ytical characterization technique with high efficiency single atom detecti
 on for quantitative atom scale 3D compositional analysis and elemental map
 ping of chemical heterogeneities. This talk will cover APT operational the
 ory\, an introduction to sample prep and data reconstruction\, and an over
 view of various applications. A commercial cryo-UHV solution for FIB-APT s

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Postdoc
 \, Public\, Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\nStatus: review\n\nS
 ince 2009 women have received a majority of the doctoral degrees granted b
 y U.S. institutions.In several scientific fields women have made great str
 ides\, whereas in a number of STEM areas the progress has been substantial
 ly slower.\n\nin 2017 women received 53% of the doctorates in Biological a
 nd Agricultural Sciences and 70% in the Health and Medical Sciences.In con
 trast\, women earned only 23% of the doctorates in engineering\, 25% in ma
 thematics and computer sciences\, and 34% in the physical and earth scienc
 es.\n\nOver the years\, the percentage of tenure-line female faculty membe
 rs in the physical sciences\, engineering\, and mathematics has remained l
 ow. Findings from an analysis of the responses to surveys and site visit d
 iscussions that involved over 1200 administrators\, chemistry and chemical
  engineering faculty members\, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows 
 will be discussed. The hiring rate of female faculty members and factors c
 ontributing to their career choices will also be addressed.\n\nReception f
 ollows in the atrium.\n\nAbout the Speaker\n\nValerie J. Kuck\, worked at 
 Bell Laboratories\, Lucent Technologies in Murray Hill\, New Jersey for 34
  years. Most of her research was focused on the stabilization of polyolefi
 ns used in copper insulate\, identification and application of high temper
 ature coatings for optical fibers and the development of new devices.\n\nW
 hile at Bell Labs she became active in the North Jersey Section of the Ame
 rican Chemical Society (ACS). Shortly thereafter\, she was elected to repr
 esent the section and serve as its representative to the national organiza
 tion. Subsequently\, she was appointed or elected to chair five national c
 ommittees. She was then elected to serve nine years on the ACS Board of Di
 rectors and chaired the Board Committee on Grants and Awards.\n\nAs a comm
 ittee chair\, she instituted a number of successful efforts. Those include
 d in having more talented women appointed to national committees and propo
 sed for leadership roles in the Society so that the number of women active
  in the Society reflected their distribution in the membership. She initia
 ted procedures to substantially increase the numbers of women nominated an
 d receiving national ACS awards\, especially those based on technical acco
 mplishments. She worked to enhance the Society’s efforts in supporting t
 he unemployed by originating and presenting workshops at Local\, Regional 
 and National meetings and serving as a career consultant.\n\nThose efforts
  led her to assist in the development of workshops that were presented at 
 many universities to assist graduate students and post-docs in planning fo
 r their careers. She proposed a new event\, Sci-Mix\, which is now the mos
 t attended session held at national meetings\, to facilitate chemists in m
 eeting others with similar technical interests. Twice she organized specia
 l symposia on very late breaking scientific discoveries. With no publicity
 \, those sessions drew collectively 10\,000 national meeting attendees and
  made the national news and were covered in the popular press. She also pu
 shed for enhanced laboratory safety training in academe along with greater
  access to safe chemical handling procedures.\n\nKuck has received several
  awards from Bell Labs and three national awards from the ACS for her lead
 ership\, dedication\, and numerous efforts to help women and others in adv
 ancing their careers. She was named a distinguished alumnus by Saint-Mary-
 of-the-Woods College\, and by her graduate school\, Purdue University. She
  has authored 41 publications and has been granted 25 U.S. patents.\n\nAbo
 ut the Phillips 66 / C.J. “Pete” Silas Program in Ethics and Leadershi
 p\n\nEthics\, leadership\, and quality\, grounded in strong communication 
 skills and professionalism\, are essential components of an engineering ed
 ucation. To spotlight the importance of these core values\, in 1995 the Ph
 illips Petroleum Foundation awarded a grant to the School of Chemical & Bi
 omolecular Engineering to develop the Phillips 66/C.J. “Pete” Silas Pr
 ogram in Ethics and Leadership.\n\nNamed in recognition of the outstanding
  professional achievements of Georgia Tech chemical engineering alumnus C.
 J. “Pete” Silas\, who retired from Phillips Petroleum as chairman and 
 CEO in 1994\, the program focuses on technical and business decisions that
  have ethical ramifications. These topics and related areas in engineering
 \, technology and ethics are integrated into the core chemical and biomole
 cular engineering curriculum and are addressed in an annual public symposi
 um featuring prominent industrialists and ethicists.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http:

 , Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\nStatus: published\n\nAbstract
 :\n\nPlaydate — a tiny\, yellow\, handheld game console — made a bigge
 r splash than its creators envisioned when it was announced this past May.
  Relying on a combination of old tech (a 1-bit black-and-white display)\, 
 new design (from Sweden’s renowned Teenage Engineering) and some just-pl
 ain-weird ideas (a side-mounted crank as a game controller)\, software mak
 er Panic Inc. hopes that Playdate can carve itself a niche in a video game
  marketplace where giants dominate. The story is still in-progress — Pla
 ydate won’t be released until next year — but Greg Maletic\, Panic’s
  Director of Special Projects\, will give you an insider’s peek at the d
 ecisions that have driven Playdate’s conception\, design\, manufacture\,
  and marketing.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\nGreg Maletic has had a varied career th
 at includes software development\, theme park design\, and consumer electr
 onics. Maletic currently is the Director of Special Projects at Panic Inc.
 \, where he leads a small team developing Playdate\, a new handheld video 
 game console shipping in 2020. Prior to Panic\, Greg worked with Walt Disn
 ey Imagineering\, developing attraction concepts and drawing illustrations
  for use in Disney theme parks. In 2007\, Maletic combined his love of fil
 m with his overwhelming interest in games and technology\, releasing the d
 ocumentary TILT: The Battle to Save Pinball. TILT chronicles the developme
 nt of “Pinball 2000”\, Bally/Williams last-ditch effort to save the dy
 ing pinball industry. Maletic’s early work experience is in software dev
 elopment and marketing\, first at Apple as a product manager for MacOS\, l
 ater as a co-founder of Zero G Software\, a software tools maker sold to M
 acrovision in 2005.\n\nSchedule of Brown Bag Speakers Fall 2019 [1]\n\nLin

 published\n\nA Frontiers in Science Lecture to celebrate 2019\, the Intern
 ational Year of the Periodic Table\nFor more than half a century\, dedicat
 ed and eager groups of scientists have contrived ways to introduce heavier
  and heavier elements into the universe. Their efforts finally completed t
 he seventh row of the famous—if poorly understood—periodic table of th
 e chemical elements.\n\nNow all 118 elements have names\, even though most
  spontaneously decay more quickly than you can say “Oganesson” or “L
 ivermorium.”\n\nWhat now? Continue? Try to start another row? Why? To wh
 at end\, and at what cost?\n\nThis talk will explore the economic\, societ
 al\, and scientific benefits and drawbacks inherent in this pursuit.\n\nAb
 out the Speaker\n\nMonica Halka [1] is an experimental physicist whose res
 earch focused on the interaction of light with atoms.\n\nShe has coauthore
 d a set of six volumes on the periodic table [2]\, which examines historic
 al\, astrophysical\, and practical observations about each of the chemical
  elements.\n\nShe serves as associate director of the Honors Program at Ge
 orgia Tech [3]\, where she teaches courses in optics\, energy science\, an
 d the nuclear age\, among others.\n\nAbout Frontiers in Science Lectures\n
 Lectures in this series are intended to inform\, engage\, and inspire stud
 ents\, faculty\, staff\, and the public on developments\, breakthroughs\, 
 and topics of general interest in the sciences and mathematics. Lecturers 
 tailor their talks for nonexpert audiences.\n\nAbout the Periodic Table Fr
 ontiers in Science Lecture Series\nThroughout 2019\, the College of Scienc
 es will bring prominent researchers from Georgia Tech and beyond to expoun
 d on little-discussed aspects of chemical elements:\n\n- Feb. 6\, James So

 \nAnna Liu\nPh.D. Candidate The Wallace H Coulter Department of Biomedical
  Engineering\nGeorgia Tech\n\nUltrafast Microfluidic Cell Compression for 
 Convective Intracellular Macromolecule Delivery\n\nEfficient intracellular
  delivery of target macromolecules remains a major obstacle in cell engine
 ering\, cell labeling\, and other biomedical applications. Our lab has dis
 covered the unique cell biophysical phenomenon of convective intracellular
  macromolecule delivery using mechanically induced\, transient cell volume
  exchange. Ultrafast microfluidic cell compressions are used to cause brie
 f\, deformation­induced cell volume loss followed by volume recovery thro
 ugh uptake of surrounding fluid. Macromolecules suspended in the surroundi
 ng fluid enter the cell on convective fluid currents. We harness this cell
  volume exchange behavior for high-throughput\, convective intracellular d
 elivery of large macromolecules\, including plasmids (>10 kb) and particle
 s (>30 nm)\, while maintaining high cell viability (>95%). Successful expe
 riments in transfection and intracellular labeling demonstrate potential t
 o overcome the most prohibitive challenges in intracellular delivery for c
 ell engineering.\n\nJenni Li\nUndergraduate Researcher\nGeorgia Tech\n\nIn
 vestigating Health Effects of Aerosol Particles on Single-cells in a High-
 throughput Air-liquid Interface Platform\n\nAir pollution and its detrimen
 tal health effects have been an increasingly alarming concern for the worl
 d. Cardiovascular diseases\, chronic respiratory diseases\, and different 
 types of cancers can all be linked to air pollution effects. Furthermore\,
  over 4 million people die per year from the direct effects of ambient par
 ticulate matter. One conventional method for studying the health effects o
 f aerosol particles is to collect particulate matter (PM) from the atmosph
 ere\, resuspend the PM in cell culture media\, add the PM/media to cell cu
 ltures\, and assess single cell oxidative stress. However\, this method do
 es not resemble the in vivo conditions of alveolar macrophages. Alveolar m
 acrophages are found in the alveoli of the lungs where the oxygen and carb
 on dioxide exchange between blood and air takes place and are a key cell t
 ype that is affected by PM. In this project\, we aim to create a microflui
 dic air-liquid interface environment that mimics how alveolar macrophages 
 are exposed to PM in order to study effects of PM at a single-cell level. 
 Utilizing a microfluidic platform provides uniform microenvironment and en
 ables high-throughput and high content single-cell analysis for hundreds o
 f cells. We adapted a previously developed microfluidic single-cell analys
 is technology and developed a method for exposing cells to an air-liquid i
 nterface. We then characterized cells by microscopy and LIVE/DEAD staining
  to assess if cells remain viable during air exposure. Following this vali
 dation of the air-liquid interface platform\, we will use it to study the 
 single cell responses of intracellular reactive oxygen species in exposure
  to aerosol particles.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.edu/node/625922#0\

 h-dimensional single-cell analysis has become critical to basic and clinic
 al research. In traditional flow cytometry\, the spectral overlap between 
 fluorophores requires complicated data compensation and limits the number 
 of markers measured\, thus creating speed\, labor and reproducibility bott
 lenecks. Mass Cytometry overcomes these limitations by utilizing antibodie
 s labelled with rare earth metals. 2019 has been the most active year yet 
 in the mass cytometry community with over 200 publications to date. CyTOF
 ® technology has also been adopted by multiple consortia and in more than
  40 clinical trials.\nThe Helios™\, a CyTOF® system permits the analysi
 s of 37+ unique targets on a per-cell basis enabling unparalleled insight 
 into the phenotype and function of cell populations from normal and diseas
 ed states in a single tube. Additionally\, barcoding for Mass Cytometry al
 lows combining up to 20 samples in one tube for increased efficiency and t
 o eliminate sample to sample variation.\nIn this seminar\, we will describ

 eness of the impact of implicit bias and facilitate equitable decision-mak
 ing across myriad processes related to faculty evaluations. As a participa
 nt in the workshop\, you will learn the following:\n\n• An introduction 
 to the concept of implicit bias and how these unconscious\, automatic ment
 al processes may impact behaviors such as evaluating candidates during fac
 ulty search and/or RPT processes.\n\n• Empirical research on vitaes\, le
 tters of recommendations\, and teaching evaluations to illustrate the impa
 ct of implicit bias on decisions.\n\n• Effective practices and strategie
 s for faculty search and RPT committees.\n\nThese workshops will be facili
 tated by Julie Ancis\, associate vice president\, Institute Diversity\; Pa

 \nThe Machine Learning Center at Georgia Tech invites you to a seminar by 
 Chandrajit Bajaj from the University of Texas.\n\nTITLE\nLearning the Koop
 man Operator for Dynamic Data\n\nABSTRACT\n\nRecent work in the study of d
 ynamic systems has focussed on data-driven decomposition techniques that a
 pproximate the action of the Koopman operator on observable functions of t
 he underlying phenomena.\n\nIn particular\, the data-driven method of dyna
 mic mode decomposition (DMD) has been explored\, with multiple variants of
  the algorithm in existence\, including extended DMD\, DMD in reproducing 
 kernel Hilbert spaces\, a Bayesian framework\, a variant for stochastic dy
 namical systems\, and a variant that uses deep neural networks.\n\nIn this
  talk\, I shall briefly summarize the large existing work on data-driven l
 earning of Koopman operator models\, and then describe new sampling-based 
 sketching approaches (SketchyCoreSVD\, SketchyCoreTucker) together with ma
 trix-valued Kernels\, to achieve accelerated Koopman operator approximatio
 ns of dynamic observable data. Examples are drawn from remote sensing and 
 FTIR hyperspectral tensor images\, bio-medical cardiac magnetic resonance 
 video\, and time series reactive flow simulations of a single ejector comb
 ustion process.\n\nBIO\nChandrajit Bajaj is the Computational Applied Math
 ematics Chair in Visualization\, professor of computer science\, and direc
 tor of the Center for Computational Visualization at the University of Tex
 as at Austin. Bajaj earned his undergraduate degree in electrical engineer
 ing from the Indian Institute of Technology\, and his master's and Ph.D. i
 n computer science from Cornell University. He is an IEEE\, ACM\, and AAAS
  Fellow\, and has won numerous best paper awards throughout his career. Ba
 jaj has also served as the editor of various publications including ACM Co
 mputing Survey\, SIAM Journal on Imaging Sciences\, and the International 
 Journal of Computational Geometry and Applications. He has authored severa
 l books [1].\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.edu/node/622930#0\n[1]  http

 :\n\nDr. Berns will discuss how the domestic dog’s accessibility\, socia
 l intelligence\, and co-evolutionary history with humans provides a unique
  opportunity to study homologous brain function in a naturalistic way that
  cannot be done with any other species. Dr. Berns will show how dogs can b
 e trained to cooperatively participate in fMRI studies – without restrai
 nt or anesthesia – and how this has opened up a wealth of new data about
  canine brain function. These results have identified the circuitry of pot
 entially homologous functions ranging from reward and face processing to r
 udiments of language perception. And because dogs live with humans\, they 
 offer a unique opportunity to study the neurobiology of inter-species soci
 al cognition. Machine-learning approaches can be used to “decode” the 
 dog brain. Finally\, because the dogs participate in repeated scan session
 s over their lifetimes\, the project has created a unique longitudinal coh
 ort\, which\, in some cases has allowed the detection of CNS tumors before
  symptoms appear and the monitoring of tumor regression following radiatio
 n treatment.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\nDr. Berns is the Distinguished Professor o
 f Neuroeconomics and Psychology at Emory University\, where he directs the
  Facility for Education & Research in Neuroscience. Trained as a biomedica
 l engineer\, he was also a practicing psychiatrist in the Department of Ps
 ychiatry at Emory University and was one of the founding members of the fi
 eld of neuroeconomics\, using fMRI to study mechanisms of decision-making 
 in humans. In 2011\, he launched an effort to train dogs to cooperatively 
 participate in fMRI studies\, resulting in the first demonstration of its 
 feasibility. Since then\, he has trained and scanned 100 dogs on a wide va
 riety of cognitive paradigms.\n\nSchedule of Brown Bag Speakers Fall 2019

 \nProf. Blair Brettmann - School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering\
 , School of Materials Science and Engineering\, Georgia Institute of Techn
 ology\nAbstract: Electrospinning is a valuable production method for nanos
 cale polymeric fibers. However\, a major limitation of the technology is t
 he requirement for the use of high molecular weight polymers as a major pa
 rt of the matrix. Many applications would benefit from a more expansive ra
 nge in the materials able to be electrospun\, including pharmaceuticals\, 
 wearable devices and diagnostics\, and active filtration. In order to real
 ize these more advanced functional materials\, composites of polymers and 
 particles must be developed and a strong understanding of how particle inc
 lusion affects the electrospinning process and mat properties is essential
 . In this work\, we examine material systems containing various polymers a
 nd active particles\, focusing on how inclusion of particles affects elect
 rospinnability and functionality of the fibrous mat. We have found that po
 lymer solutions with high conductivity\, hence narrow fiber diameters\, te
 nd to trap particles in a web-like structure\, rather than within individu
 al fibers. Other polymer-particle systems exhibit a ‘bunches of grapes
 ’ morphology where the particles agglomerate yet the polymer matrix stil
 l surrounds them and connects the bunches with fibers. These interesting m
 orphologies can be explained by conductivity\, rheology\, and particle int
 eractions in the polymer solution. We also examine how particle inclusion 
 affects the viscoelasticity of the solutions and tie this to the electrosp
 inning process window\; showing that a finite window of viscoelasticity yi
 elds optimal electrospinnability. We use these fundamental results to elec
 trospin materials for advanced functional applications such as pharmaceuti
 cals and conducting polymers and provide outlook for further work in incre
 asing the range of materials that are electrospinnable.\n\nBio: Blair Bret

 t\n\nThe Alliance for the Development of Additive Processing Technologies 
 (ADAPT) is developing a combined physics – machine learning platform for
  assessing Process-Structure-Property relationships in metals additive man
 ufacturing. An added benefit of this approach is the inherent statistical 
 core of the models – the AI platform is not only capable of learning the
  PSP relations of AM\, but also providing statistical reports on part qual
 ity and variation in a manner conducive to certification. In this presenta
 tion\, it will be shown how such a framework can be used to optimize parts
 \, processes\, and materials for metals additive manufacturing\, resulting
  in reduced times and costs for qualifications. The parts example will cov
 er accelerated qualification of a 17-4 Stainless Steel door hinge for an A
 rmy ground vehicle. The materials example will document ways and means to 
 make laser powder bed fusion manufactured Inconel 718 stronger & more duct
 ile than wrought material. The processes example will show how machine lea
 rning can be used to determine the parameters for a new printer that has a
  more powerful laser than previous generations of machines\, with verifica
 tion carried out in printing Ti-64 coupons. These examples will be motivat
 ed with a vision for how networks of 3D printers that share a common datab
 ase can shift paradigms in manufacturing.\n\nBiography\n\nAaron is the Row

 egion on Australia’s east coast is home to the world’s largest coal ex
 port operation. More tons of coal are exported each year from the port of 
 Newcastle\, at the mouth of the Hunter River\, than from any other port in
  the world. Coal exported is mined by more than 10 competing producers ope
 rating upward of 40 mines\, but uses shared infrastructure to reach the po
 rt\, be blended into final products held in stockyards and loaded onto ves
 sels at berth. The shared infrastructure\, which consists of rail lines\, 
 trains\, stockyards\, stockpile stacking and reclaiming machinery\, berths
 \, vessel loading machinery\, the river channel and tug boats\, is owned a
 nd/or operated by several different organizations. All of these organizati
 ons must coordinate their activities so as to deliver coal in an effective
  and efficient way. In this talk\, we will discuss how collaboration betwe
 en the many stakeholders has been shaped and evolved\, how collaboration h
 as been essential to the delivery of productivity gains in this complex lo
 gistics system\, and will touch on the critical role analytics and the too
 ls of operations research have played.​\n\nSESSION SPEAKER\n\nNatashia B

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Graduate students\, Undergraduate students\
 nStatus: published\n\nSpeaker: Dr. Morris B. Cohen\, Associate Professor\,
  School of ECE\n\nTitle: Career directions in ECE\n\nAbstract: It’s an a
 mazing time to be an ECE major. The need for ECE skills has expanded into 
 places where it never existed before\, like the auto industry. The need fo
 r data analytics permeates nearly every industry\, new and traditional. Bu
 t there are a lot of ways to make a contribution in your career\, and thou
 gh you shouldn’t at all feel obligated to define your career now\, the p
 urpose of this talk is to try and make sure you’ve heard of them. I’ll
  give you a brief overview of my career and research meandering but only b
 rief\, and the rest is to talk about where ECEs can and do go.\n\nSpeaker 
 Bio: Morris Cohen received his B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical Engine
 ering from Stanford University in 2003 and 2010\, respectively\, and serve
 d as a research scientist until August 2013. From September 2012 until Aug
 ust 2013\, Dr. Cohen was appointed as AAAS Science and Technology Policy F
 ellow at the National Science Foundation.\n\nIn Fall 2013\, he joined the 
 faculty in the School of ECE. He is a winner of the NSF CAREER Award in 20
 17\, the ONR Young Investigator Award in 2015\, and was chosen for the San
 timay Basu Prize in 2014\, an award given once per 3 years to an under-35 
 scientist by the International Union of Radio Science (URSI).\n\nDr. Cohen
  is interested in the natural electricity of the Earth\, including lightni
 ng\, the electrically charged upper atmosphere\, and the radiation-filled 
 space environment. He uses radio waves at low frequencies measured all aro
 und the world to understand them\, and develops resulting practical applic
 ations. His group also works on novel techniques to generate low frequency
  waves with nonconventional electrically-short antennas. He is an author o
 f more than 60 journal publications. He employs a “flipped classroom” 
 model in some of his courses to make the experience more active and engagi
 ng.\n\nHe enjoys hiking\, cooking\, traveling\, and building pizza ovens.\
 n\nResearch interests:\n\n- Radio wave emissions from lightning\n- Advance
 d signal processing of low frequency radio data\n- Global lightning geoloc
 ation\, mapping\, and characterization\n- Low frequency radio waves in the

 , Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\nStatus: published\n\nAbstract
 :\n\nWhen we think about technology mediating human interactions with data
 \, we often think about how it improves the practices of people’s usual 
 activities\, from making them more mindful of their daily movements throug
 h step-tracking devices\, to improving capabilities to make informed busin
 ess decisions using data-rich analytics in a digital dashboard. This talk 
 explores how technologies can expand people to look beyond what they usual
 ly do: how can a zoomable interface spark wonder about aquatic insects to 
 engage non-scientists in water quality monitoring\, and how can a touchscr
 een inspire new questions about familiar objects to foster cross-cultural 
 dialogues? I will present multiple projects integrating interactive techno
 logies as mediators of informal\, social learning and argue for the import
 ance of technology’s role in provoking empathy\, curiosity\, and engagem
 ent to drive and expand interest in unfamiliar domains.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\
 nJessica Roberts is an assistant professor in the School of Interactive Co
 mputing at Georgia Tech. She holds a PhD in Learning Sciences from the Uni
 versity of Illinois-Chicago with a concentration in geospatial analysis an
 d visualization and a B.S. from Northwestern University with a concentrati
 on in theatre design. Her research examines how people learn through\, wit
 h\, and about data in out-of-school environments such as museums and citiz
 en science activities and how interactive technologies mediate social\, in
 formal learning experiences. Her work on the design of interactive learnin
 g technologies has won paper awards at CSCL and CHI\, and her projects hav
 e been exhibited at venues including the Field Museum of Natural History i

 ed alumnus John Huff\, CE 68\, who will share highlights from his extraord
 inary career in business\, engineering and exploration. In three decades o
 f leadership\, Huff has helped Oceaneering International become the premie
 r organization in underwater technologies. His pioneering advancements hav
 e served customers operating in a wide variety of harsh environments—fro
 m deep ocean basins to outer space. Huff began his career working for offs
 hore drilling companies after graduating from Georgia Tech. This experienc
 e\, and his penchant for adventure\, eventually led him to became presiden
 t and CEO of Oceaneering\, which he transformed from a small offshore oil 
 and diving company into a highly successful multinational corporation. Huf
 f achieved this by tying oil exploration with deep sea exploration. In add
 ition to many other achievements\, the company developed the remote-operat
 ed vehicles that assisted in the exploration of the Titanic\, the wreckage
  of the Challenger capsule\, and the remains of the H.L. Hunley\, a Civil 
 War-era submarine.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.edu/node/626062#0\n[1]

 :\n\nMorphing matter harnesses the programmability in material structures 
 and compositions to achieve transformative behaviors and integrates sensin
 g\, actuation\, and computation to create adaptive and responsive material
  systems. These material systems can be leveraged to design soft robots\, 
 self-assembling furniture\, adaptive fabrics\, and self-folding foods. In 
 this talk\, Lining presents the recent works in the Morphing Matter Lab\, 
 Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University and hig
 hlights several robotic morphing materials that weave advanced manufacturi
 ng with computational tools. Her team believes that the term “robotics
 ” does not only refer to conventional robotic forms and controls but als
 o connects to the artifacts’ ability to make decisions\, adapt\, move\, 
 and respond to different stimuli. More information from the lab site: http
 s://morphingmatter.cs.cmu.edu/.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\nLining Yao is an Assist
 ant Professor of Human-Computer Interaction Institute (HCII) at Carnegie M
 ellon University\, School of Computer Science\, directing the Morphing Mat
 ter Lab. Morphing Matter lab develops materials\, tools\, and applications
  of adaptive\, dynamic and intelligent morphing matter from nano to macro 
 scales. Research often combines material science\, computational fabricati
 on and creative design practices. Lining and her lab work anti-disciplinar
 ily\, publishing and exhibiting across science\, engineering\, design and 
 art. Lining gained her PhD at MIT Media Lab\, where she combined biologica
 l and engineering approaches to develop physical materials with dynamic an
 d tunable properties including shape\, color\, stiffness\, texture and den
 sity. Beyond her teaching and research in the School of Computer Science\,
  Lining holds courtesy appointments at Mechanical Engineering\, as well as
  Material Sciences and Engineering. She is supervising undergraduate and g
 raduate students across the College of Engineering and College of Art.\n\n

 Abstract: Organic\, hybrid\, and 2D materials have attracted interest for 
 electronic applications due to their potential for use in low-cost\, large
 -area\, flexible electronic devices. Here we will report on recent develop
 ments pertaining to surface modifiers and dopants that could impact the ch
 arge injection/collection/transport processes in organic light emitting di
 odes\, organic field effect transistors\, and photovoltaic devices. In par
 ticular\, we will examine how N-heterocylic carbenes assemble on gold subs
 trates\, the impact of the surface dipole on the work function of the gold
 . We will also discuss the development of metallocenes-based dimers as n-d
 opants and very briefly describe metal dithiolene complexes as p-dopants f
 or organic semiconductors and their impact of device performance.\n\nBio:

 , Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\nStatus: published\n\nAbstract
 :\n\nDigital technologies have increasingly begun to permeate the driving 
 experience in recent years to support continually increasing information a
 nd cognitive needs associated with driving and non-driving activities in t
 he car. With recent pilot projects like Waymo\, Uber\, and Tesla\, we can 
 anticipate that autonomous driving technology will have a significant impa
 ct on accelerating the transformation of automobile interface in its more 
 than one hundred years long history. As the technology matures\, and initi
 al public enthusiasm wanes\, designing a better user experience within thi
 s new mode of travel will be of critical importance for our future. In thi
 s talk\, we examined the user experience issues that will arise with the i
 ntroduction of autonomous driving including the attention-activity changes
  and related design considerations. We then discuss current disciplinary-s
 pecific design methodologies and introduce a more comprehensive approach t
 o the design space to optimize the opportunities for user interaction with
  examples to meet the changes in the vehicle and the associated transporta
 tion service.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\nAs an assistant professor\, Dr. Wei Wang 
 brings industrial and international experience to the Industrial Design pr
 ogram at Georgia Institute of Technology. His research interests stand in 
 the interactive technology\, human-computer interaction and smart product 
 design from user experience perspective. He is directing DesigNext lab in 
 School of Industrial Design on the applications of emerging interface desi
 gn in future consumer electronics. His patents in gesture interaction and 
 mobile service have been applied widely in consumer products by Nokia and 
 Microsoft. Wang won multiply international awards\, included the Annual En
 gagement and Enterprise Awards from Queen Mary University of London (UK)\,
  Annual Achievement Awards from Nokia (Finland)\, the Science and Technolo
 gy Award of China Mechanical Industry (China)\, and the Michelin Challenge
  Design Award in the worldwide. Wang used to work in Nokia Research Center
 \, Hunan University and Queen Mary University of London before he joined G
 eorgia Tech in 2016. Wang is a member of IDSA and ACM SIGCHI\, and receive
 d his Ph.D. in design in 2008.\n\nSchedule of Brown Bag Speakers Fall 2019

 \nTITLE: Edge Computing: A New Disruptive Force\n\nABSTRACT:\n\nAt the hei
 ght of its success\, cloud computing is yielding to edge computing. Why is
  this happening? What is the unique value proposition of edge computing? A
 s real-world deployments of edge computing appear\, how will the lives of 
 end users be improved? What new applications and capabilities will they se
 e? Which applications run best at the edge\, which run best in the cloud\,
  and which should straddle the edge and cloud? How do we build systems tha
 t are seamless to the user but leverage all the available tiers of computi
 ng to best effect? Based on my team’s decade-long exploration of edge co
 mputing\, I will share my insights on these questions. Of particular inter
 est is a new class of “wearable cognitive assistance” applications tha
 t lie at the convergence of edge computing\, wearable devices\, and cognit
 ive algorithms (e.g. computer vision\, speech recognition\, natural langua
 ge processing). Drawing upon insights from these edge-native applications\
 , I will explore what hardware and software infrastructure is needed for e
 dge computing.\n\nBIO:\n\nSatya’s multi-decade research career has focus
 ed on the challenges of performance\, scalability\, availability\, and tru
 st in information systems that reach from the cloud to the mobile edge of 
 the internet. In the course of this work\, he has pioneered many advances 
 in distributed systems\, mobile computing\, pervasive computing\, and the 
 internet of things (IoT). As described in How we created edge computing\, 
 Satya’s seminal 2009 publication The Case for VM-based Cloudlets in Mobi
 le Computing\, and the ensuing research has led to the emergence of edge c
 omputing (also known as fog computing). Satya is the Carnegie Group Profes
 sor of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. He received his Ph.
 D. in computer science from Carnegie Mellon after bachelor’s and master
 ’s degrees from the Indian Institute of Technology\, Madras. He is a Fel
 low of the ACM and the IEEE. For a more detailed bio\, see Satya’s Wikip

  per unit cell\, all atoms play the same role in producing the solid's glo
 bal response to external perturbations. Disordered materials are not simil
 arly constrained and a new principle emerges: independence of bond-level r
 esponse. This allows one to drive the system to different regimes of behav
 ior by successively removing individual bonds. We can thus exploit disorde
 r to achieve unique\, varied\, textured and tunable global response or lon
 g-range interactions inspired by allosteric behavior in proteins. While th
 is approach is successful for systems with only a few degrees of freedom\,
  it is difficult to scale up the number of elements to be controlled or sc
 ale down the size of the individual components. However\, because a materi
 al has a memory of under what conditions it has been aged\, we can direct 
 the aging using Nature’s greedy algorithms to achieve a variety of mecha
 nical functionalities.\n\nABOUT THE SPEAKER\n\nSidney Nagel is the Stein-F

 \, Public\, Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\, Freebies\nStatus: 
 published\n\nA Frontiers in Science Lecture to celebrate 2019\, the Intern
 ational Year of the Periodic Table\nThe Cold War rivalry between the Unite
 d States and the Soviet Union lasted for much of the second half of the 20
 th century. While the superpowers never engaged directly in full-scale arm
 ed combat\, a nuclear arms race became the centerpiece of a doctrine of mu
 tually assured destruction\, and prompted a mass production of plutonium\,
  and the designing\, building\, and testing of large numbers of nuclear we
 apons.\n\nIn more than 50 years of operation\, the Cold War battlefields c
 reated over 100 metric tons of plutonium\, produced tens of thousands of n
 uclear warheads\, oversaw more than 1000 detonations\, and left behind a l
 egacy of contaminated facilities\, soils\, and ground water.\n\nThe extent
  of long-term adverse health effects will depend on the mobility of pluton
 ium and other actinides in the environment and on our ability to develop c
 ost-effective scientific methods of removing or isolating actinides from t
 he environment. Studying the complex chemistry of plutonium and the actini
 des in the environment is one of the most important technological challeng
 es\, and one of the greatest scientific challenges in actinide science tod
 ay.\n\nDavid L. Clark will summarize our current understanding of actinide
  chemistry in the environment\, and how that understanding was used in the
  decontamination and decommissioning of the Rocky Flats Site\, where pluto
 nium triggers for U.S. nuclear weapons were manufactured. At Rocky Flats\,
  synchrotron radiation measurements made at the Stanford Synchrotron Radia
 tion Laboratory were developed into a science-based decision-making tool t
 hat saved billions of dollars by focusing site-directed efforts in the cor
 rect areas\, and aided the most extensive cleanup in the history of Superf
 und legislation to finish one year ahead of schedule\, ultimately resultin
 g in billions of dollars in taxpayer savings. (LA-UR-15-22406)\n\nAbout th
 e Speaker\n\nDavid L. Clark [1] is a Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL)
  Fellow and Director of the Laboratory’s National Security Education Cen
 ter. He received a B.S. in chemistry in 1982 from the University of Washin
 gton\, and a Ph.D. in 1986 from Indiana University.\n\nClark was a postdoc
 toral fellow at the University of Oxford before joining Los Alamos Nationa
 l Laboratory as a J. Robert Oppenheimer Fellow in 1988. He became a Techni
 cal Staff Member in the Isotope and Nuclear Chemistry Division in 1989. Si
 nce then he has held various leadership positions at Los Alamos\, includin
 g PI for the Laboratory’s BES Heavy Element Chemistry program (1993 – 
 2014)\, Solubility Task for the Yucca Mountain Project (1993-1997)\, Sourc
 e Term Test Program for the WIPP license application (1996-1997)\, program
  manager for plutonium aging and pit lifetime assessments\, (1998-2003)\, 
 and Capture Manager for the Plutonium Science and Research Strategy (2009 
 – 2019).\n\nClark has been highly involved in service to the actinide ch
 emistry community through organization of ACS symposia (1993-present)\, se
 rvice on organizing and steering committees of 3 international actinide co
 nferences including Actinides (1993-present)\, Migration (2003 – present
 )\, and Plutonium Futures – the Science (1997-present)\; the establishme
 nt and stewardship of the Seaborg Institute at Los Alamos (1997-2009)\; th
 e development of the Plutonium Science and Research Strategy (2009-present
 )\; and much more.\n\nHe has served the DOE as a technical advisor for env
 ironmental stewardship including the Rocky Flats cleanup and closure (1995
 -2005)\, closure of High-Level Waste tanks at the Savannah River Site (201
 1)\, and as a technical advisor to the DOE High Level Waste Corporate Boar
 d (2009-2011).\n\nHe is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advan
 cement of Science\, and a Los Alamos Laboratory Fellow. He is the recipien
 t of two ACS national awards - the Nobel Laureate Signature Award (1988) a
 nd the Glenn Seaborg Award in Nuclear Chemistry (2017). He has also been h
 onored with several Defense Programs Awards of Excellence\, the most notab
 le in 2006 for his work on pit lifetime assessments for the nation.\n\nHis
  research interests are in the molecular and electronic structure of actin
 ide materials\, applications of synchrotron radiation to nuclear security\
 , behavior of actinide and fission products in the environment\, the aging
  effects of nuclear weapons materials\, and the education of judges on the
  methods of science.\n\nHe is an international authority on the chemistry 
 and physics of the actinides\, and has published over 175 peer-reviewed pu
 blications\, encyclopedia and book chapters.\n\nAbout Frontiers in Science

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Postdoc
 \nExtras: Free food\nStatus: published\n\nHow do your grading practices im
 pact your students? Research shows that not all grading practices motivate
  student learning. In fact\, some practices have the opposite effect. For 
 example\, grade curving: did you know grade curving demotivates students? 
 Goergia Tech students have said that grade curving promotes stress\, cheat
 ing\, competition\, and even apathy Students feel there is little room to 
 ever fail and that if they do\, their grade is unlikely to recover. Additi
 onally\, feedback regarding the curve does not come in early enough for st
 udents to determine whether or not they should drop the class.\n\nWhile cu
 rving is a common problematic grading practice\, it isn’t the only one. 
 However\, equitable grading practices that are mathematically accurate\, r
 esistant to bias\, and motivating to students to achieve academic growth a
 nd success can refocus students on learning\, not just the grade. Many ins
 tructors wish to apply these principles in their teaching\, but it can be 
 difficult to determine how to do so\, leaving faculty to wonder how to be 
 both fair and rigorous when grading.\n\nThese topics will be further explo
 red in the Center for Teaching and Learning workshop\, Grading: Are Both E
 quity and Rigor Possible? Participants will ponder common grading approach
 es through the lens of equity to identify opportunities to restore some co
 mpassion to the grading process while still using grades to accurately ref
 lect student learning. The primary goals of the workshop are to help instr
 uctors to consider why they use their grading style compared to available 
 alternatives\, understand grades in the context of how they affect the mot
 ivation\, learning\, and well-being of their students\, and develop an awa
 reness of equitable versus non-equitable grading strategies.\n\nJoin us [1

 e a space for graduate students to come together in a welcoming environmen
 t to discuss\, share experiences and offer each other suggestions while bu
 ilding a community. Free dinner will be provided. The first session will b

 \, and personal excellence. Learn about their career journeys that led the
 m to security\, how they apply their interests and training to their curre

 the next generation of women in security.\n\nPanelists:\n• Meghan Caputo

 urity Risk\n\n• Courtney Healey\, Senior Director\, Security Awareness\n
 \n• Jamila Ramsay\, Senior Director\, Enterprise Application\, Security 
 and Analysis & Metrics Reporting\n\nThe terms security and cybersecurity a
 re often used interchangeably referring to the profession narrowly defined
  as a team of professionals who leverage technologies and processes to def
 end an organization’s systems and networks from attack. However\, this n
 arrow use of security sells the field short – there are in fact a number
  of key functions under the security umbrella\, one of which is cybersecur
 ity\, all of which are essential to the success of the organization. Some 
 such functions are: physical security\, fraud prevention\, privacy\, busin
 ess continuity\, disaster recovery\, and risk management\, although there 
 are still more. And though the security field is defined by the technical 
 “hacker” persona\, people with backgrounds\, skills\, and interests of
  a wide variety have all found success under the umbrella of work in the s
 ecurity field.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.edu/node/627447#0

SUMMARY:GVU Center Brown Bag: Yanni Loukissas "All Data Are Local: Thinkin

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Public\
 , Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\nStatus: published\n\nAbstract
 :\n\nIn our data-driven society\, it is too easy to assume the transparenc
 y of data. Instead\, Yanni Loukissas argues in All Data Are Local\, we sho
 uld approach data sets with an awareness that data are created by humans a
 nd their dutiful machines\, at a time\, in a place\, with the instruments 
 at hand\, for audiences that are conditioned to receive them. The term dat
 a set implies something discrete\, complete\, and portable\, but it is non
 e of those things. Examining a series of data sources important for unders
 tanding the state of public life in the United States—Harvard's Arnold A
 rboretum\, the Digital Public Library of America\, UCLA's Television News 
 Archive\, and the real estate marketplace Zillow—Loukissas shows us how 
 to analyze data settings rather than data sets.\n\nLoukissas sets out six 
 principles: all data are local\; data have complex attachments to place\; 
 data are collected from heterogeneous sources\; data and algorithms are in
 extricably entangled\; interfaces recontextualize data\; and data are inde
 xes to local knowledge. He then provides a set of practical guidelines to 
 follow. To make his argument\, Loukissas employs a combination of qualitat
 ive research on data cultures and exploratory data visualizations. Rebutti
 ng the “myth of digital universalism\,” Loukissas reminds us of the me
 aning-making power of the local.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\nYanni Alexander Loukis
 sas is an Assistant Professor of Digital Media in the School of Literature
 \, Media\, and Communication at Georgia Tech\, where he directs the Local 
 Data Design Lab. His research is focused on helping creative people think 
 critically about the social implications of emerging technologies. His new
  monograph from MIT Press\, All Data Are Local: Thinking Critically in a D
 ata-Driven Society\, is addressed to a growing audience of practitioners w
 ho want to work with unfamiliar data both effectively and ethically. Origi
 nally trained as an architect at Cornell\, he subsequently attended MIT\, 
 where he received a Master of Science and a PhD in Design and Computation 
 and completed postdoctoral work at the Program in Science\, Technology and
  Society.\n\nSchedule of Brown Bag Speakers Fall 2019 [1]\n\nLinks:\n[0]

 ing\nProfessor\, Materials Science and Engineering\nArthur F. Thurnau Prof
 essor\, Mechanical Engineering\nJanine Johnson Weins Professor\n\nThe firs
 t concept that will be explored in this talk is the time-dependent nature 
 of cracking in polymeric coatings\, with a particular interest in the coat
 ings for automotive polymeric glazing. Experiments suggest that crack velo
 cities in these particular systems\, while sensitive to visco-elastic prop
 erties\, are controlled by kinetic processes.\nThe second topic will addre
 ss the adhesion of ice to polymeric coatings. In particular\, the work ill
 ustrates the dual role that both interfacial strength and interfacial toug
 hness play in determining the conditions for delamination. Experimental st
 udies show that the force required to delaminate a layer of ice from a pol
 ymeric coating depends on the scale of the problem.\n\n“Collecting Long-

 \nPetit Distinguished Lecture by Wendell Lim\, University of California\, 
 San Francisco\n\nThe eras of molecular biology and genomics have given us 
 an unprecedented picture of the molecular components underlying living sys
 tems. Nonetheless\, our understanding of how these components are assemble
 d to generate precision physiological systems remains far less developed.\
 n\nTo approach this problem\, we and others have been using synthetic biol
 ogy methods to empirically explore how molecular components can be used to
  construct novel cellular functions. Using these approaches\, we have show
 n that we can reprogram living cellular machines that carry out new precis
 ion functions\, including therapeutic immune cells that precisely recogniz
 e and eliminate cancer cells\, or cells that self-organize into tissues.\n
 \nBy merging our understanding of cellular machines with our knowledge of 
 our bodies and its diseases\, we envision the development of a mature fiel
 d of cell engineering with a toolbox of optimized molecular parts and circ
 uit architectures\, as well as disease and "GPS" sensors that allow the ce
 ll to target specific sites in the body or brain.\n\nSuch a platform will 
 allow us to rapidly and flexibly prototype and design cells that can ident
 ify sites of disease or degeneration and execute precisely targeted and co
 ntrolled therapeutic actions.\n\nAbout the Speaker\nWendell Lim is the Bye
 rs Distinguished Professor and Chair of the Department of Cellular and Mol
 ecular Pharmacology at the University of California\, San Francisco. He is
  an Investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.\n\nHe received hi
 s A.B. in Chemistry\, summa cum laude\, from Harvard College and his Ph.D.
  in Biochemistry and Biophysics from he Massachusetts Institute of Technol
 ogy. He completed postdoctoral training at Yale University.\n\nHis researc
 h focuses on the design principles of molecular circuits that govern cell 
 decision-making and responses. His lab has made contributions in understan
 ding the molecular machinery of cell signaling and how molecular modules h
 ave been used in evolution to build novel new behaviors.\n\nMost recently 
 he has been a pioneer in the emerging field of synthetic biology\, explori

 \nProf. John Rogers - Depts. of Materials Science and Engineering\, Biomed
 ical Engineering and Medicine\; Northwestern University\nAbstract: A remar
 kable feature of modern integrated circuit technology is its ability to op
 erate in a stable fashion\, with almost perfect reliability\, without phys
 ical or chemical change. Recently developed classes of electronic material
 s create an opportunity to engineer the opposite outcome\, in the form of 
 ‘transient’ devices that dissolve\, disintegrate or otherwise disappea
 r at triggered times or with controlled rates. Water-soluble transient ele
 ctronics serve as the foundations for interesting applications in zero-imp
 act environmental monitors\, 'green' consumer electronics and bio-resorbab
 le biomedical implants. This presentation describes the foundational conce
 pts in chemistry\, materials science and assembly processes for bioresorba
 ble electronics in 1D\, 2D and 3D architectures. Wireless sensors of intra
 cranial temperature\, pressure and electrophysiology designed for use in t
 reatment of traumatic brain injury and nerve stimulators configured for ac
 celerated neuroregeneration provide application examples.\n\nBio: John A. 
 Rogers is the Louis Simpson and Kimberly Querrey Professor of Materials Sc
 ience and Engineering\, Biomedical Engineering and Medicine at Northwester
 n University\, with affiliate appointments in Mechanical Engineering\, Ele
 ctrical and Computer Engineering and Chemistry\, where he is also Director
  of the newly endowed Center for Bio-Integrated Electronics. He has publis
 hed more than 650 papers\, is a co-inventor on more than 100 patents and h
 e has co-founded several successful technology companies. His research has
  been recognized by many awards\, including a MacArthur Fellowship (2009)\
 , the Lemelson-MIT Prize (2011)\, and the Smithsonian Award for American I
 ngenuity in the Physical Sciences (2013) – and most recently the Benjami

SUMMARY:GVU Center Brown Bag: Krystina Madej "Disney Animation: Story and 
 Technology"

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Public\
 , Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\nStatus: published\n\nAbstract
 :\n\nWalt Disney is described variously as an American entrepreneur\, a fi
 lm producer\, a pioneer of the American animation industry\, the founder o
 f the theme park industry. Public perception of him is of a filmmaker with
  an uncanny ability to create entertaining family oriented animated films 
 and experiences. More than that Walt Disney was a visionary who believed t
 echnology should be pushed to its limits to realize stories\, provide expe
 riences\, and build worlds. That a technology did not exist or was not yet
  ready to solve a problem was not an obstacle – his answer was always 
 – build it.\n\nDisney Stories: Getting to Digital (Lee & Madej\, 2012) d
 iscusses how Walt Disney and then the Walt Disney Company narratives evolv
 ed from traditional animation to computer games and online narrative exper
 iences. In the upcoming second edition (January 2020) I look at technology
  as it has been used to enhance story from the first feature animation Sno
 w White and the Seven Dwarfs to the first VR short Cycles. This talk first
  provides an overview of the technological innovation that has driven the 
 many arms of the Disney empire\, most recently the animatronics for the ne
 w Star Wars worlds at Walt Disney World and Disneyland. This is followed b
 y a presentation of Disney advances in technology made in the genre of ani
 mated films from the 1940s to today as Disney moved from the traditional m
 ethods of integrating animation and live action in Song of the South and l
 ater Mary Poppins\, to CGI assisted films beginning with Tron\, through ma
 ny iterations to Big Hero Six\, and finally to VR and its use in shorts su
 ch as Styles.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\nKrystina Madej is Professor of Practice a
 t Georgia Tech\, Atlanta\, where she has taught since 2011. Her research i
 nterests are play and games\, interactivity and collaboration in social me
 dia\, material culture of media\, and narrative across media. In particula
 r she looks at children’s traditional and digital games\, play and narra
 tives in social media and Disney’s approach to narrative and technology.
  Her research has resulted in a number of books including Physical Play an

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Postdoc
 \, Public\, Undergraduate students\nStatus: published\n\nIn 2016\, Georgia
  Tech collected preliminary data through an online survey of 771 students.
  The report found that 10% of Georgia Tech’s students responded being in
  need of food assistance and that 16% prioritized working at their job ove
 r academics and extracurricular activities. Georgia Tech’s actions to fi
 ll this gap include opening Klemis Kitchen in 2015\, an on-campus food pan
 try that provides leftover food from the dining halls and Panera Bread as 
 well as canned donations from other sources. However\, in Spring 2019\, on
 ly 100 students have self-identified and enrolled in the program\; a far c
 ry from the 10% of students estimated in the 2016 survey.\n\nTo ensure bot
 h the highest levels of health and academic performance of all GT students
 \, we need to understand the effects of food insecurity/security on health
  and academic performance\, identify effective methods of recognizing stud
 ents who are food insecure\, and develop interventions to that will increa
 se food security among those students who are food insecure. The purpose o
 f this preliminary study is to address the first two issues. Our specific 
 aims are 1) to understand the impact of food security/insecurity on academ
 ic performance and 2) identify passive tools that can predict profiles of 
 food insecure students that are specific to students within a semester per
 iod.\n\nModerators:\n\nJon Sanford\, Professor\, School of Industrial Desi

 ghtweight Composites\nBrina Blinzler\, Assistant Professor Division of Mat
 erial and Computational Mechanics\, Department of Industrial and Materials
  Science Chalmers University of Technology\, Göteborg\, Sweden\n\nAbstrac
 t\n\nHigh performance polymer matrix composites (PMC) have a high specific
  stiffness and can be used to easily manufacture highly complex components
 . Hierarchical composite materials with microstructures designed for speci
 fic multifunctional purposes are an important development area for modern 
 materials. The demand for new materials is increasing and the rate at whic
 h those new materials should complete the development cycle is decreasing.
  In order to meet this demand\, existing material development frameworks m
 ust be enhanced via more progressive human-computer materials development.
  A few techniques are presented to meet this need including: a combination
  of modern imaging techniques and finite element analysis of in-situ fiber
  bundles\, a stochastic approach utilizing experimental through-thickness 
 scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of nanocomposites to create virt
 ual representations of the experimental microstructure\, an adaptation of 
 hierarchical materials developed in nature\, and the potential for a low e
 nergy\, high performance processing methods.\n\nBiography\n\nDr. Brina Bli
 nzler is an Assistant Professor in Composite Mechanics at Chalmers Univers
 ity of Technology. Her research focuses on composite process modeling\, me
 chanics\, and material informatics. She leads the all Wood Composites Plat
 form and is a representative for the Chalmers Graphene Center in the Focus
  Area: Multifunctional Composites and Coatings. She has recently received 
 the Jacob Wallenbergs Foundation: Material Science Research Award (2019) a
 nd the Hasselblad Foundation: Female Scientist Award (2018). Previously\, 
 Dr. Blinzler conducted research at Scaled Composites\, Easton Baseball/ So
 ftball and other companies. In addition\, she was a recipient of the NASA 
 Graduate Student Researchers Program fellowship\, holds a PhD in Civil Eng
 ineering from the University of Akron and BS in Civil Engineering from Mis
 souri University of Science and Technology.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gate

 n German\nDirector of the Georgia Tech Center for Urban and Regional Air M
 obility (CURAM)\n\nPizza Provided\nOver the past two years\, the term "urb
 an air mobility (UAM)" has entered the vernacular of the aerospace industr
 y. Silicon Valley unicorns\, individual billionaires\, startup companies\,
  automotive firms\, and traditional aerospace manufacturers worldwide are 
 investing in the development of over 200 electric vertical takeoff and lan
 ding (eVTOL) aircraft to serve the UAM market. Often called "flying cars" 
 or "air taxis\," these aircraft designs are novel\, incorporating many new
  technologies. We are entering only the early days of UAM\, an era of grea
 t uncertainty. No one understands whether and how the market will emerge. 
 No one understands how eVTOL aircraft will be certified. No one understand
 s how to manage the airspace in cities when filled with air taxis. No one 
 understands how cities will regulate "vertiports" where aircraft will land
  to embark and disembark passengers. No one understands which aircraft des
 igns will "win" and how the best design varies city to city. In this era o
 f uncertainty\, there is great opportunity\, and there is great risk. This
  talk will provide an introduction to the current landscape of urban air m
 obility\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.edu/node/628104#0

 :\n\nLook around at some of the familiar objects and materials in your sur
 roundings. These things can be transformed. By combining everyday material
 s with computing\, we can extend and reimagine their expressive and functi
 onal possibilities. We can also invite people to explore a new design spac
 e through making. In this talk\, HyunJoo will present her recent work in i
 ntegrating paper and recycled materials with computing and discuss a suite
  of computational design tools her research team has developed. She will d
 escribe how combinations of everyday materials with computation can expand
  creative possibilities while leveraging familiarity to empower designers 
 and learners.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\nHyunJoo Oh is an assistant professor with
  a joint appointment in the School of Industrial Design and the School of 
 Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech. Working at the intersection of Huma
 n-Computer Interaction and Design\, she develops computational design tool
 s that integrate everyday materials with computing. Her work investigates 
 fundamental questions on how people see and think\, and make\, in particul
 ar how those are closely linked and shape each other. Her work has been pu
 blished and exhibited at ACM SIGCHI conferences such as CHI\, TEI\, and DI
 S\, and featured in venues including CNET and Maker Ed.\n\nSchedule of Bro

 \, Public\, Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\, Freebies\nStatus: 
 published\n\nA Frontiers in Science Lecture to celebrate 2019\, the Intern
 ational Year of the Periodic Table\nIn 1997\, the Japanese oceanographer Y
 oshiyuki Nozaki compiled a periodic table of ocean chemistry\, encapsulati
 ng the distribution of elements as a function of depth. In this periodic t
 able\, many elements share similar patterns\, classified into just a few c
 ategories. The similarities indicate a common set of mechanisms behind the
  ocean cycling of elements.\n\nThe interaction of ocean circulation\, chem
 istry\, and biology sets the distribution of elements in the ocean. For ex
 ample\, nonreactive elements are nearly uniformly distributed in the water
  column\, homogenized by ocean circulation and mixing.\n\nNutrient element
 s are depleted near the surface because of biological consumption and enri
 ched in mid-depth due to decomposition of organic matter. Some trace metal
 s – such as Fe\, Zn\, Ni\, and Cd – follow this pattern. In contrast\,
  some heavy metals – like Al\, Mn\, Co\, and Pb – are subsumed into pa
 rticles and removed from seawater.\n\nBuilding on the insights from Nozaki
 ’s periodic table\, this talk will interpret recent measurements of chan
 ging seawater chemistry\, highlighting the importance of rising carbon dio
 xide concentration in the air\, climate change\, and pollution of rivers a
 nd atmosphere.\n\nAbout the Speaker\nTakamitsu “Taka” Ito [1] is an as
 sociate professor in the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences\, where 
 he teaches physical and chemical oceanography. He received a Ph.D. in Eart
 h\, Atmospheric\, and Planetary Sciences in 2005 from Massachusetts Instit
 ute of Technology. His research has focused on the cycling of carbon\, oxy
 gen\, and iron in the global oceans\, using observations\, theory\, and co
 mputational modeling.\n\nAbout Frontiers in Science Lectures\nLectures in 
 this series are intended to inform\, engage\, and inspire students\, facul
 ty\, staff\, and the public on developments\, breakthroughs\, and topics o
 f general interest in the sciences and mathematics. Lecturers tailor their
  talks for nonexpert audiences.\n\nAbout the Periodic Table Frontiers in S
 cience Lecture Series\nThroughout 2019\, the College of Sciences will brin

 discussed aspects of chemical elements:\n\n- Feb. 6\, James Sowell\, How t

 :\n\nAs industrial design continues to embrace digital manufacturing\, we 
 are in constant danger of losing the culturally indicative crafts that exp
 ress individual cultures. As global wealth inequality grows\, can we creat
 e low tech\, parametric tools to bring products to global market? Does the
  spread of generative design in products have to mean a drop in artisanal 
 jobs that support entire towns and regions? Can we blur the line between d
 esigner and maker by working collaboratively? In this talk we look at ways
  that new design tools can go to emerging and potential markets to create 
 opportunity without losing jobs\, skills\, and traditions.\n\nThis topic c
 an connect design to production by looking upstream\, encourages socially 
 sustainable practice. This can allow us to design for production near the 
 material source taking advantage of embodied skills instead of homogenizin
 g design.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\nLisa Marks is an industrial designer whose wo
 rk combines craft and algorithmic design. She uses technological adaptatio
 ns of traditional techniques to promote sustainable methods of production 
 that help endangered craft communities. Her work has been presented at des
 ign weeks in New York\, Milan\, and Bangkok and has recently won the 2019 
 International Grand Prix Lexus Design Award. Lisa holds an MFA from Parson

 ircadian systems.\n\nConsidering the age-related changes in eyes and circa
 dian system\, specialized lighting design is essential to promote overall 
 health and well-being in older people.\n\nThis seminar describes specific 
 lighting needs of older adults\, explores scientific methods to design hea
 lthy environmental lighting for this age group\, and outlines a recently c
 onducted study which evaluates the effects of tuning ambient illuminations
  on improving sleep quality and cognitive functions in older adults.\n\nLi

 \nTITLE: Software Testing: And the Challenges (and Opportunities) Keep Com
 ing!\n\nABSTRACT:\n\nDisruptive shifts in software application types and s
 oftware development environments create challenges to software testing tha
 t need to be addressed to ensure software quality and reduce the cost of s
 oftware development time. Over the years\, the size and complexity of soft
 ware have grown as well as the need for fast-changing codebases\, fault de
 tection strategies\, and test case generation and selection. To meet these
  challenges\, techniques such as regression testing\, selection/prioritiza
 tion\, and fault localization have been developed as well as specialized t
 esting techniques for GUIs\, object-oriented software\, mobile computing\,
  and continuous evolution of software to name a few. This talk presents an
  overview of these challenges and solutions and references Mary Jean Harro
 ld’s achievements in these areas. The talk then explores current challen
 ges and opportunities that bring problems that cannot be solved by state o
 f art techniques\, including applications that are machine learning applic
 ations or use machine learning as part of a system where components intera
 ct and evolve. Other challenges that need to be explored involve autonomou
 s systems\, cloud applications\, and data churn. As software becomes more 
 autonomous\, its operations and outputs become less predictable at test wr
 iting time\; hence\, the traditional nature of assert (Actual\, Expected) 
 test oracles does not work and needs to be addressed.\n\nBIO:\n\nMary Lou 
 Soffa is the Owen R. Cheatham Professor of Sciences in the Computer Scienc
 e Department at the University of Virginia\, serving as the department cha
 ir from 2004 to 2012. Her research interests include software testing\, pr
 ogram analysis\, warehouse scale computing\, software systems for multi-co
 re architectures\, and optimizing compilers. She has published over 175 ar
 ticles and has directed 32 Ph.D. students to completion\, half of whom are
  women and including Mary Jean Harrold. Soffa is an ACM and IEEE Fellow. O
 ther notable awards include the Ken Kennedy Award for contributions to com
 piler technology\, the IEEE Software Engineering Women in Science and Engi
 neering Leadership Award\, and the Anita Borg Technical Leadership Award. 
 For her career-long dedication to diversity in computing\, she received th

 \nAssistant Professor Sung Jin Park | Coulter Department of Biomedical Eng
 ineering\, Georgia Institute of Technology & Emory University\, School of 
 Medicine\nAbstract: Utilizing living materials as building blocks for engi
 neered biohybrid systems enables replicating biological activities in vitr
 o at a cellular\, tissue and organ level. Furthermore\, integrating stem c
 ell technologies offer new strategies of personalized medicine\, from enab
 ling drug discovery to engineering transplantable artificial organs. In th
 is talk\, I will focus on our tissue-engineering approach to recapitulate 
 biological functions at tissue- and system- levels\, by advancing the cont
 rol of living building blocks. First\, I will discuss optogenetic approach
  for the development of biohybrid soft-robotic swimmers capable of coordin
 ated muscle contraction and undulatory swimming. Second\, I will present t
 he development of tissue-level model of a human inherited cardiac monogeni
 c disease\, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia\, which 
 can recapitulate exercise-induce arrhythmia upon optogenetic and catechola
 mine stimulation. Both biohybrid examples illustrate the potential and pro
 gress of the biohybrid systems to transform human muscle disease models as
  well as artificial tissues and organs.\n\nBio: Sung Jin Park\, PhD\, is a
 n Assistant Professor in the Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering 
 at Georgia Tech and Emory University School of Medicine. He received Bache
 lor's and Master's degrees in Mechanical Engineering from Seoul National U
 niversity in Korea\, and his PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Stanford U
 niversity with double Master's degree in Electrical Engineering. He then c
 ontinued postdoctoral research at the John A. Paulson School of Engineerin
 g and Applied Sciences and Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engine
 ering at Harvard University\, where he developed engineered biological sys
 tems using living materials as building blocks. He has focused on enabling
  the control of biological systems across scales from artificial cells\, t
 o engineered tissues\, to artificial soft-robots\, in order to better reca
 pitulate biological activities and to build more complex living system. Hi
 s work on tissue-engineered soft-robotic rays and photosynthetic organelle
 s was selected as a cover of Science and Nature Biotechnology. The tissue-
 engineered ray was also selected as one of Popular Science best inventions
  of year 2016 and Gold Edison Award of 2017 and featured in more than 100 
 news outlets such as New York Times\, BBC\, Financial Times\, and Economis
 t.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.edu/node/627352#0\n[1]  http://ien.gat

 ational Year of the Periodic Table\nChemical elements have played importan
 t roles in the geopolitics of modern times and will continue to do so.\n\n
 From Einstein’s 1939 letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt [2] highl
 ighting the need to secure uranium ores\, to an insurgency fought over pho
 sphorus\, to a Chinese embargo of rare-earth elements in retaliation for a
  maritime incident in the East China Sea\, to “blood batteries” for el
 ectric vehicles dependent on cobalt mined by child laborers in the Democra
 tic Republic of Congo\, to calls for new international agreements on aster
 oid mining\, the role of elements in geopolitics is vast and significant.\
 n\nWhat does this mean for the U.S.\, for the rest of the world\, and for 
 the future of technology?\n\nAbout the Speaker\nMargaret E. Kosal [3] is a
 n associate professor in Georgia Tech’s Sam Nunn School of International
  Affairs. She directs the Sam Nunn Security Program and the Program on Eme
 rging Technology and Security. She is also a member of the Parker H. Petit
  Institute for Bioengineering and Bioscience. Her research explores the re
 lationships among technology\, strategy\, and governance.\n\nShe is the au

 book explores scenarios\, benefits\, and potential proliferation threats o
 f nanotechnology and other emerging sciences. She is the editor of “ Tec
 hnology and the Intelligence Community: Challenges and Advances for the 21
 st Century [5].” The book examines the role of technology in gathering\,
  assimilating and utilizing intelligence information through the ages. She
  is editor-in-chief of Politics and the Life Sciences [6]. The journal pub
 lishes original scholarly research at the intersection of political scienc
 e and the life sciences.\n\nKosal has served as a senior advisor to the Ch
 ief of Staff of the Army and as science and technology advisor in the Offi
 ce of the Secretary of Defense.\n\nTrained as an experimental scientist\, 
 Kosal earned a Ph.D. in Chemistry from the University of Illinois\, Urbana

 -mile delivery (i.e.\, the delivery of merchandise to a store or end user)
 \, is a prime target for digital transformation. It is the most expensive 
 and fastest growing leg of the supply chain and often the most critical to
  customer satisfaction. Unfortunately\, it is also the most complex leg of
  the supply chain. We will discuss the delivery characteristics and trends
  that make digital transformation a necessity. We will also discuss the fi
 ve stages of digital transformation necessary to optimize delivery systems
 : 1. Data digitization\; 2. Business intelligence\; 3. Predictive analytic
 s\; 4. Automated delivery planning\; and Adaptive management. Finally\, we
  will examine the advances in technology that enable transformation of las
 t-mile delivery.\n\nRegister Online for upcoming SCL IRC seminars [2]\n\nA

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Public\
 , Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\nStatus: review\n\nAbstract:\n
 \nThe built environment in today’s hybrid cities is changing radically. 
 The pervasiveness of networked mobile and embedded devices has transformed
  a predominantly stable background for human activity into spaces that hav
 e a more fluid behavior. Based on their capability to sense\, compute\, an
 d act in real time\, urban spaces have the potential to go beyond planned 
 behaviors and\, instead\, change and adapt dynamically.\n\nThese interacti
 ons resemble improvisation in the performing arts\, and this talk presents
  a new improvisation-based framework for thinking about future cities. Kri
 stian Kloeckl moves beyond the smart city concept by unlocking performativ
 ity\, and specifically improvisation\, as a new design approach and explor
 es how city lights\, buses\, plazas\, and other urban environments are cap
 able of behavior beyond scripts.\n\nDrawing on research of digital cities 
 and design theory\, he makes improvisation useful and applicable to the co
 ndition of today’s technology-imbued cities and proposes a new future fo
 r responsive urban design.\n\nThis talk is a preview of the forthcoming bo
 ok „The Urban Improvise. Improvisation-Based Design for Hybrid Cities“
  by Kristian Kloeckl and published by Yale University Press. http://www.ur
 banimprovise.com/\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\nKristian Kloeckl is a designer and as
 sociate professor at Northeastern University’s School of Architecture an
 d Department of Art + Design where he heads the graduate program in Experi
 ence Design. Prior to that\, he was a faculty member at the University IUA
 V of Venice and a research scientist at MIT\, leading the Real Time City G
 roup at Senseable City Lab\, and establishing the lab’s research unit in
  Singapore. Kloeckl’s work probes the boundaries of interaction design i
 n the context of today’s hybrid cities and investigates the role of impr
 ovisational frameworks for design. He is the author of the forthcoming boo
 k “The Urban Improvise. Improvisation-Based Design for Hybrid Cities” 
 published by Yale University Press and his work has been exhibited at venu

 roducing and utilizing videos in their courses. Have you ever wondered how
  students are using these resources? Are you concerned that students might
  not be watching the videos or might be skipping through them? Have you ev
 er thought about how you could make your videos more engaging? Watching vi
 deos is a very passive activity--but it doesn’t have to stay that way\, 
 thanks to innovative technologies that allow you to add interactive featur
 es to your videos.\n\nIn this spotlight workshop\, we will explore the tec
 hnology and pedagogy behind Interactive Video Quizzes from Kaltura. We’l
 l examine how you can use Kaltura to create quizzes that exist inside vide
 os and describe how you can best leverage this technology in your own cour
 ses. We’ll also discuss the concept of frequent quizzing and explain how
  such a technique can benefit student learning. And we’ll hear from Dr. 
 Tatiana Rudechenko\, a faculty member in Scheller\, who has successfully i
 mplemented video quizzing in her own course. Tatiana will share her experi
 ence\, lessons learned\, and tips for using this technique with your stude
 nts.\n\nJoin us and learn first-hand about video quizzing and generate ide
 as for innovative uses with your colleagues. Bring your laptop to get a ju
 mp on creating your own video quizzes by engaging in hands-on activities o
 r simply follow along with someone at your table. All are encouraged to at
 tend--from novices who have just started to think about creating videos to
  experts looking to add another tool to their video skill set. We look for
 ward to seeing you!\n\nLunch will be provided. Please register [1] to join

 \nTITLE: Lessons from Designing\, Building\, and Operating a Hyper-scale G
 lobal Wide Area Network\n\nABSTRACT:\n\nCloud computing has ushered in a n
 ew class of hyper-scale systems\, characterized by large-scale distributed
  systems\, global connectivity\, and ubiquitous computing models that span
  the spectrum from centralized data centers to the edge. Powering these hy
 per-scales are global networks that connect end-users through various othe
 r networks and devices to the cloud. In this talk\, we describe our journe
 y in building the network of one of the biggest cloud systems\, Microsoft 
 Azure. This network is built out of 130K+ miles of terrestrial and subsea 
 cables\, processes an average of 30 billion packets/second\, and interconn
 ects with more than 20K peering points around the globe. We describe many 
 of the technological and engineering building blocks that enable us to bui
 ld and reliably operate this network\, including innovations in fiber opti
 cs\, software-defined networking\, network design\, switch software and gl
 obal-scale monitoring\, and simulation software.\n\nBIO:\n\nYousef Khalidi
  is responsible for product and program management for Azure Networking\, 
 which covers Microsoft’s global investments in cloud networking software
  and hardware. He drives strategic business planning\, including world-wid
 e partner coverage and deep integration with Microsoft services. Khalidi w
 as a member of the team that conceived and built the initial version of Mi
 crosoft Azure (code named Red Dog) and has served in several engineering\,
  product management\, and architectural roles in Azure. Prior to joining M
 icrosoft\, Khalidi spent 14 years at Sun Microsystems\, where he was a dis
 tinguished engineer. At Sun\, he held several R&D\, architecture\, and man
 agement positions in enterprise software\, including CTO and chief archite
 ct of Solaris\, chief architect of Sun’s N1 utility computing platform\,
  chief architect and director of the Sun Cluster product line\, and as a p
 rincipal architect of the Solaris MC and the Spring advanced development p
 rojects. Khalidi also served as a member of Sun’s Technical Advisory Cou

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Postdoc
 \, Public\, Undergraduate students\nStatus: published\n\nYou're invited to
  attend the talk\n\n"Structural Design in Motion: Computational Synthesis 
 of Kinetic Structures Using Topology Optimization"\n\nby\n\nProf. Kai Jame
 s\nAssistant Professor\nUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\n\nThur
 sday\, November 14\n3 - 4 PM\nGuggenheim 442\n\nAbout the Talk:\nTopology 
 optimization is a powerful and well-established tool for generating optima
 l structural designs. Unlike the sizing and shape optimization approaches 
 that preceded it\, this method simultaneously optimizes both the shape and
  topology of the structure\, thus creating the potential to algorithmicall
 y generate novel design concepts and configurations with minimal input fro
 m human designers. This capability makes topology optimization a potential
  key ingredient in the quest to achieve automated design of complex mechan
 ical systems.\n\nThis talk will discuss our ongoing efforts to expand the 
 capability of the topology optimization method to enable computational syn
 thesis of kinetic structures. This unique class of structures is designed 
 to exhibit precisely tailored motion\, while maintaining structural integr
 ity. The talk will present our general methodology and results from severa
 l example problems including optimal design of a bi-stable airfoil\, multi
 material design of self-actuating mechanisms containing shape memory polym
 ers\, and topology optimization of multi-body mechanisms. The talk will co
 nclude with a discussion of ongoing and future research projects in which 
 we explore the use of topology optimization for the design of soft robots 
 and compound machines.​\n\nAbout the Speaker:\nKai James is an Assistant
  Professor in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the University of
  Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\, and the Principal Investigator of the Comp
 utational Design Innovation Lab at UIUC. From 2012 to 2015\, he was a post
 doc in the Computational Mechanics Group at Columbia University\, and he e
 arned his PhD in aerospace engineering from the University of Toronto in 2
 012. His research focuses on computational solid mechanics and computation
 al design optimization with an emphasis on problems involving various sour
 ces of nonlinearity\, such as viscoelastic creep\, superelasticity\, and l
 arge deformations.\n\nHe is especially interested in developing novel algo
 rithms that leverage high-fidelity computational models and topology optim
 ization methods for conceptual design and synthesis of complex engineering
  structures. Some of his major research projects include aerostructural op
 timization of transonic aircraft wings\, structural design optimization of
  a cardiovascular stent\, optimal design of a bi-stable airfoil\, and comp
 utational synthesis of multi-body systems. Dr. James is the recipient of t
 he NSF CAREER award (2018)\, and has also received several teaching honors
  including being named “Teacher of the Year” by the UIUC chapter of th
 e American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics in 2017.\n\nLinks:\n[

 n————————————\n\nIn this era of big data\, one of 
 the most crucial fields in Computer Science is data mining. Extracting mea
 ningful information from a large amount of data in a reasonable time becam
 e possible mainly through two types of advancements - a) algorithmic\, suc
 h as fast approximate algorithms and efficient learning algorithms\, and b
 ) architectural\, such as machines with massive compute power involving di
 stributed multi-core processors and high throughput accelerators. With the
  end of Dennard scaling\, the free lunch in performance improvement throug
 h processor frequency increases ended\, and multiple cores became a practi
 cal solution to gain performance. In current-generation processors\, paral
 lelism is ubiquitous\, and thus parallel algorithms are a necessary means 
 to utilize computing resources efficiently. In our work\, we address the f
 ollowing questions - how well do the critical data mining algorithms of cu
 rrent interest fit with today's parallel architectures\, which algorithmic
  and mapping opportunities can we leverage to further improve performance\
 , and what are the challenges and gains in such efforts?\n\nFirst\, we inv
 estigate a classical application in large scale data stream processing - t
 he frequency estimation problem - for GPU scale parallelism. Among the app
 roximate solutions with sublinear memory requirements\, Sketching algorith
 ms are a popular choice for this task due to their desirable trade-off bet
 ween estimation accuracy and space-time efficiency. However\, most of the 
 past work on sketch-based frequency estimation focused on CPU implementati
 ons\, with little exploration of throughput-optimized parallel architectur
 es such as GPUs. In our work\, we propose a novel approach for sketches\, 
 which exploits the natural skewness in the data to efficiently utilize the
  massive amounts of parallelism available in modern GPUs.\n\nNext\, we exp
 lore one of the most common and important tasks in data mining - identific
 ation of most frequent elements - on modern distributed settings with both
  multi-node as well as multi-core parallelism. In this work\, we start by 
 observing that the existing approximate algorithms\, although theoreticall
 y sound\, are suboptimal from the performance perspective. Specifically\, 
 for identifying top-K frequent items\, Count-Min Sketch (CMS) has an excel
 lent update time but lacks the important property of reducibility\, which 
 is needed for exploiting available massive data parallelism. On the other 
 end\, the popular Frequent Algorithm (FA) leads to reducible summaries\, b
 ut the update costs are high. Our approach Topkapi\, a fast and parallel a
 lgorithm for finding top-K frequent items\, gives the best of both worlds\
 , i.e.\, it is reducible like FA and has an efficient update time similar 
 to CMS. In addition\, Topkapi possesses strong theoretical guarantees and 
 leads to significant performance gains\, relative to past work.\n\nFinally
 \, we explore opportunities for improvement in Word2Vec\, a word embedding
  method. Word embedding is an essential application for Machine learning a
 nd Natural Language Processing\, since distributed representations of word
 s significantly improve accuracy in text processing applications\, such as
  machine translation\, sentiment analysis\, and query answering. This time
 \, we target Single Instruction Multiple Data parallelism. With increasing
  vector length of commodity CPUs\, such as AVX-512 with a vector length of
  512 bits\, efficient vector processing unit utilization becomes a major p
 erformance game-changer. So\, we look into the performance landscape for c
 urrent Word2Vec approaches on CPUs and propose new ideas to overcome their
  shortcomings.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.edu/node/628952#0

 g Jin Park\, Ph.D. - Assistant Professor\, Coulter Department of Biomedica
 l Engineering\; Georgia Institute of Technology & Emory University School 
 of Medicine\nAbstract: The cellular phenotypes caused by inherited arrhyth
 mia mutations have been studied using human induced pluripotent stem cell 
 derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). However\, arrhythmias are the emergent
  properties of cells assembled into tissues\, and the impact of these muta
 tions on tissue-level properties of human myocardium has not been reported
 . In this talk\, I will present an in vitro hiPSC-CM-based platform to stu
 dy the tissue-level properties of engineered human myocardium. I will illu
 strate how this hiPSCCM- based platform can be used to investigate pathoge
 nic mechanisms in the deadly\, exercise-triggered inherited arrhythmia cat
 echolaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT). In addition\, I
  will show how we combined this novel platform with genome editing and ide
 ntified new therapeutic target for CPVT.\n\nLunch Provided at 1pm\nRSVP li

 \nDr. David Bruce Burckel: Sandia National Laboratories\nAbstract: Bulk op
 tical materials like glasses and semiconductors (for infrared appli-cation
 s) have continuous translational symmetry on the scale of the design wavel
 ength\, and hence support a continuum of allowed modes with frequency depe
 ndent optical constants dictated by the material dispersion relationship. 
 Much of the recent progress in optical materials has been driven by period
 ic structuring of materials on finer and finer scales relative to the desi
 gn wave-length. Recently metasurface optics employing planar plasmonic str
 uctures ar-rayed in a two-dimensional (2D) array to affect beam steering a
 nd lensing were reported. Subsequent analysis of the physical mechanisms a
 t play revealed that such a planar system has a maximum theoretical effici
 ency of 25%. The analysis further showed that by enabling current flow in 
 the third dimension\, the direction of travel through the lens\, this rest
 riction could be lifted.\n\nIn this seminar\, I will discuss our recent wo
 rk on fabrication and characterization of 3D meta-films\, suspended struct
 ures with sub-wavelength structuring along all three dimensions and a tota
 l thickness of < 4-μm. The struc-tures are fabricated on ~ 1-μm thick si
 licon nitride membranes using a new CMOS compatible membrane pro-jection l
 ithography (MPL) approach. Elimination of the bulk substrate allows us to 
 collect almost all the transmit-ted and reflected light from the sample an
 d simplifies modeling and design. The response of these 3D meta-films poss
 esses features characteristic of the metallic meta-atoms as well as slab p
 hotonic crystal resonances resulting from the periodic unit cell array\, t
 he nitride walls and support membrane. I will outline the fabrication sequ
 ence and present measured infrared transmission characterization of 3D uni
 t cells with vertically oriented elliptical plasmonic inclusions in the un
 it cell. Furthermore\, we demonstrate control over the coupling between th
 e plasmonic modes of the metallic inclusion and photonic crystal slab mode
 s of the support matrix by adjusting the dimensions of the inclusions. The
  ability to control the coupling between the unit cell decoration and the 
 unit cell matrix while also allowing for current flow in all three dimensi
 ons offers a powerful new design element for next generation optical eleme
 nts.\n\nBio: Bruce Burckel received his BS in Electrical Engineering from 
 the University of New Mexico in 1993\, at which point he was evenly split 
 between attending graduate school\, medical school or law school. Graduate
  school won out\, probably costing him millions of dollars in lifetime ear
 nings\, but he is only mildly bitter about this. He received his MS (1995 
 – optical non-contact temperature measurement) and PhD (2004 – general
 ized transverse Bragg waveguiding) also from the University of New Mexico\
 , separated by a stint contemplating a software start-up\, studying contro
 l system theory\, designing space-based relay mirror telescopes and studyi
 ng atmospheric propagation for high power laser applications. Although his
  PhD was centered on photonic applications of interferometric lithography 
 at the micro and nano-scale\, he secured a Post-Doctoral position in an in
 organic chemistry lab studying self-assembled nanocomposite coatings. He i
 s currently a Principal Member of the Technical Staff at Sandia National L
 aboratories\, where he leads several efforts in micron-scale 3D fabricatio
 n and structured electromagnetics. He is frequently found counseling stude
 nts on the importance of career planning\, as well as studying for the LCA
 T in local coffee shops.\n\nIf you wish to meet with the speaker\, please

 :\n\nMy research combines techniques in natural language processing\, mach
 ine learning and theories in social science to better understand human lan
 guage and build intelligent systems to support human-human and human-compu
 ter communication. In this talk\, I will explain my research from two spec
 ific studies. The first part studies what makes language persuasive by int
 roducing a semi-supervised neural network to recognize persuasion strategi
 es in loan requests on crowdfunding platforms\, and further designed neura
 l encoder-decoder systems to automatically transforming inappropriately su
 bjective framing into a neutral point of view. The second focuses on model
 ing how people seek and offer support via language in online cancer suppor
 t communities and building interventions to support patient communication.
  Through these examples\, I show how we can accurately and efficiently bui
 ld better language technologies for social good.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\nDiyi Y
 ang is an assistant professor in the School of Interactive Computing at Ge
 orgia Tech. She is interested in natural language processing (such as lang
 uage generation\, semantics\, discourse)\, and social computing. Diyi rece
 ived her PhD from the Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon U
 niversity\, and her bachelor's degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University\,
  China. She has published more than 40 papers at leading NLP/HCI conferenc
 es\, and received several best paper award nominations from EMNLP 2015\, I
 CWSM 2016\, and SIGCHI 2019. She has served as an area chair for ACL\, NAA

  (UAM) with electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft is emer
 ging as a promising aviation market for both cargo delivery and passenger 
 travel. The rise of UAM is being driven by the convergence of two technolo
 gies: autonomy and electric aircraft propulsion. Although promising\, thes
 e technologies place limits on the discovery of viable markets\, the timel
 ine of introduction\, and the design of operational paradigms. In particul
 ar\, electric propulsion—when achieved with battery energy storage—is 
 highly constraining in terms of aircraft payload\, range\, and speed perfo
 rmance and in terms of operational tempo and ground infrastructure. This t
 alk will discuss recent work in modeling aircraft performance and operatio
 ns for UAM and will highlight the challenges and opportunities in particul
 ar urban markets.\n\nSESSION SPEAKER\n\nBrian German [1]\, Daniel Guggenhe

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Public\
 , Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\nStatus: review\n\nAbstract:\n
 \nGames are an important form of play. While games are played by all age g
 roups\, for children\, play and games are fundamental to learning and\, fo
 r them\, all play is serious. Serious games\, which have become a prevalen
 t game genre for adults\, need not be confined to adult or adolescent audi
 ences. Both from the perspective of serious topics and serious gameplay\, 
 older children as they head towards adolescence\, and younger children as 
 they negotiate their way through their first years of school\, warrant the
  consideration of games developed to tackle topics that are becoming incre
 asingly important to their health and well-being. In games\, social value 
 can only be created through a narrative a child can relate to. Whether we 
 turn to David Winnicott on child development\, Jerome Bruner on acts of me
 aning\, or Kieran Egan on languaged learning\, story dominates as the most
  valuable experience in the construction of a child's world and how they a
 ct within it. The added context of a personal approach\, one that is cultu
 rally relevant\, can create an influential avenue through which children c
 an be provided with opportunities for gaining knowledge about problems tha
 t\, while they may be national or global\, are local to them – knowledge
  that could be critical to their well-being and survival in an increasingl
 y hostile world. Games offer children a space that supports learning on th
 eir own. Moving from the typical to the atypical game\, from simple proble
 m solving that increases cognitive skills\, to social problem solving that
  teaches empathy\, is a shift that can happen through participation in nar
 rative dialogue. Social value in a game can exist when the cognitive load 
 is not in computing numbers but in the challenge of uncovering the more in
 triguing stories beyond the surface of coded messages. In this talk I pres
 ent a case study that describes the design thinking process of a group of 
 EU Erasmus students\, each of whom brings their own cultural perspective a
 nd personal story to addressing how they would introduce children to conte
 mporary issues\, which either affect them currently\, or will affect them 
 as they grow up\, through narrative in physically engaging games. A number
  of their final game designs are provided in outline.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\nD
 r. Krystina Madej is Professor of the Practice at Georgia Tech\, Atlanta. 
 At Tech since 2011\, she teaches about and researches how humans have adap
 ted their narratives to changing media throughout the centuries\, physical
  play and children's interaction with digital games that are based in narr
 ative\, and in Disney's approach to stories across media since the 1920s. 
 Adjunct Professor with the School for Interactive Art and Technology (SIAT
 ) at Simon Fraser University\, Vancouver\, for ten years\, she taught as V
 isiting Professor for the Center for Digital Media's Master’s degree pro
 gram. She is research faculty at University of Lower Silesia\, Wroclaw\, P
 oland where as Visiting Professor she teaches Disney History and Children
 ’s Game Design for the Erasmus Program and Design Thinking and History o
 f Social Media for the Big Data\, Digital Media\, and Trendwatching Master
 ’s Program. Prior to returning to academia in 1999\, she was principal o
 f a communications and design firm for 15 years\, where\, as design strate
 gist\, she planned and created successful branding programs and exhibits f
 or government\, business\, industry\, and museums.\n\nSchedule of Brown Ba

 n\nMatthew Hong: Personalizing Health Management Through Human-Centered Da
 ta Augmentation\n\nDuring complex chronic treatment\, adolescent patients 
 (ages 10-19) must communicate all illness needs to the care team so they c
 an access relevant health resources when most needed. This communication i
 s challenging because patients\, family caregivers and clinicians have unm
 atched experiences\, conceptions and linguistic representations of indicat
 ors of health. Most importantly\, patients lack the means to capture and r
 epresent their felt illness experience. My colleagues and I addressed thes
 e challenges by advancing personalized computing technology and human-cent
 ric methods that inform collaborative approaches for managing personal hea
 lth data. In this talk\, I will describe how technology can be designed to
  effectively scaffold patients’ gradual participation in managing their 
 illness. I draw from Health Informatics\, Participatory Design\, and Human
 -Computer Interaction to show how we can augment clinically-generated\, an

 a Martin: Understanding the Technological and Experiential Requirements of
  Improvisational Storytelling Agents\n\nAlthough we are currently riding a
  technological wave of personal assistants\, many of these agents still st
 ruggle to communicate appropriately. Humans are natural storytellers\, so 
 it would be fitting if artificial intelligence could tell stories as well.
  Automated story generation is an area of AI research that aims to create 
 agents that tell “good” stories. Previous story generation systems use
  planning to create new stories\, but these systems require a vast amount 
 of knowledge engineering. The stories created by these systems are coheren
 t\, but only a finite set of stories can be generated. In contrast\, very 
 large language models have recently made the headlines in the natural lang
 uage processing community. Though impressive on the surface\, these models
  begin to lose coherence over time. My research looks at various technique
 s of automated story generation\, focusing on the perceived creativity of 
 the generated stories. Here\, I define a creative product as one that is b
 oth novel and useful. In my dissertation\, I theorize that a jointly proba
 bilistic and causal model will provide more creative stories for readers o
 f stories generated from an improvisational storytelling system than solel
 y probabilistic or causal models.\n\nEmily Wall: Mitigating Implicit Human
  Bias in Visual Analytics\n\nImplicit bias is a term used to describe the 
 way that our culture\, experiences\, and stereotypes can unconsciously imp
 act our attitudes and decision making. Such biases\, like racial or gender
  bias\, can impact decision making in critical ways\, propagating long-sta
 nding institutional and systemic biases. However\, as decision making is i
 ncreasingly taking place with the aid of data-driven visual representation
 s (including interactive visualization tools like Tableau\, among others)\
 , we are afforded a new opportunity with respect to the detection and miti
 gation of implicit biases. In this talk\, I describe (1) how user interact
 ions with data can be used to approximate implicit biases and (2) how visu
 alization systems can be designed to make implicit biases more explicit by
  increasing awareness. By creating systems that promote real-time awarenes
 s of bias\, people can reflect on their behavior and decision making and u
 ltimately engage in a less-biased decision making process.\n\nSpeaker Bios

 CTS\n\nMichaelanne Dye\, Towards Access and Beyond: Human Infrastructures 
 in Constrained Contexts\n\nMore than four billion people across the world 
 have yet to access the internet. Despite increasing initiatives by compani
 es and governments to bring more people online\, social\, economic\, and p
 olitical barriers continue to limit internet engagements among underrepres
 ented groups. As a result\, people collaborate to overcome barriers to par
 ticipation\, particularly in politically and economically constrained cont
 exts. I address these concerns by focusing on the case of Cuba\, where up 
 until recently internet access was limited to just five percent of the pop
 ulation. Presenting results from qualitative inquiry in Havana from 2014 t
 o 2017\, I describe how participants are receiving and engaging with the i
 ncremental introduction of access to the world wide web. I also present in
 sights into how people have created their own versions of the internet in 
 response to barriers. I draw on the framework of human infrastructure to r
 eveal how people are sustaining multiple\, disconnected information networ
 ks\, and the tensions and opportunities that arise from these efforts. I w
 ill discuss how this work contributes to our understanding of the social e
 lements embedded in internet adoption and participation\, and how this cri
 tical understanding has implications for the design of social media system
 s in order to better support collaborative efforts of historically underre
 presented groups.\n\nCaitlyn Seim\, Wearable Tactile Stimulation for Strok
 e Rehabilitation\n\nStroke is one of the leading causes of disability in t
 he United States and globally. Many stroke survivors lose function in thei
 r upper extremities\, which can make it difficult to do everyday tasks lik
 e dressing or eating. In addition to weakness and loss of sensation\, spas
 ticity and tone can cause hands to be involuntarily clenched in a rigid po
 sition — a problem for which there are few effective treatments. Getting
  rehabilitation therapy can be a challenge and up to 50% of stroke survivo
 rs do not qualify for traditional exercise-based therapies. This talk intr
 oduces a novel stimulation method and mobile\, wearable devices to provide
  therapy on-the-go and to those with very limited movement. Preliminary re
 sults and next steps are presented. Our stimulation method may provide a p
 owerful tool to reduce disability after a stroke\, and the wearable form f
 actor allows users to receive intensive therapy during their normal daily 
 routine.\n\nStevie Chancellor\, Human-Centered Algorithms for Deviant Ment
 al Health Behaviors Online\n\nSocial media can provide a rich platform for
  those seeking better health and support through difficult experiences. Ye
 t\, it can also provide space for deviant mental health behaviors\, very d
 angerous and stigmatized behaviors related to mental health. These behavio
 rs are dangerous to participants as well as to platform health. However\, 
 the deep complexities of mental health and these clandestine behaviors res
 ist straightforward\, data-driven approaches to detection and intervention
 . In this talk\, I will describe how human-centered algorithms can identif
 y and assess deviant mental health behaviors in pro-eating disorder commun
 ities\, bringing insights from Human Computer Interaction\, applied data s
 cience\, and social computing. In addition\, I will show how these approac
 hes can inform platform strategies for engaging with these communities. Fi
 nally\, I will briefly discuss how human-centered insights can be brought 
 to computational methods to answer our toughest questions about deviant be
 havior online.\n\nSPEAKER BIOS\n\nMichaelanne Dye is a Ph.D. candidate in

 cally-thin two-dimensional (2D) materials (e.g. graphene and MoS2) has sho
 wed promise to create new functionalities for various biomedical applicati
 ons\, especially flexible and wearable electronics. In this talk\, I will 
 discuss how nanostructuring of atomically-thin materials could create new 
 functionalities based on the fundamental studies of mechanics and photonic
 s at nanoscale. I will first discuss how nanostructuring of atomically-thi
 n 2D materials allows for the enhancement of their exceptional material pr
 operties and creating new functionalities in mechanical\, optical\, plasmo
 nic properties. I will also introduce a shrink nanomanufacturing method de
 veloped based on nanoscale mechanics of atomically-thin materials\, includ
 ing graphene and MoS2 atomic layers. Shrink nanomanufacturing allows large
 -scale\, uniform crumpling of graphene\, a two-dimensional (2D) material\,
  enabling mechanical stretchability and strain tunability of a flexible op
 toelectronic device. I will highlight a high-performance flexible photodet
 ector developed based on the shrink nanomanufacturing approach as well as 
 its potential in flexible/wearable optical sensing technology for biomedic
 al applications.\n\nLunch will be served at the beginning of the seminar.\

 a professional football player\, as well as:\n\n- Emerging technology that
  impacts the game\n- What it takes to become a successful entrepreneur\n- 
 Opportunities for innovation in athletics\n\nAbout the speaker: Instilled 
 with hard work at a young age by his mom\, Derrick Morgan began working as
  soon he was old enough to acclimate himself to the real world. After rece
 iving more recognition on the football field during his junior year of hig
 h school\, Derrick set his mind to college football and arrived on the cam
 pus of Georgia Tech. In 2010\, his next goal was accomplished as well with
  the Tennessee Titans drafted him. While his goal was soon realized\, a to
 rn ACL injury turned Derrick’s world upside down\, forcing him to evalua
 te his value outside the football field.\n\nAbout Deep Startups: Deep Star
 tups is an events series that features knowledgeable entrepreneurs who dis
 cuss their experiences forming companies that solve big-picture current pr
 oblems. These individuals speak to the concept of ‘deep startups’ and 
 how to create companies that make a difference in specific industries. Eac
 h Deep Startups event focuses on a different broad topic in engineering/te
 chnology\, and allows for student Q&A at the end of the event.\n\nLinks:\n

 \, Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\nStatus: published\n\nScience
  has made significant gains in the fight against infectious diseases in th
 e past several decades\, perhaps the most notable of which is declining mo
 rtality rates from HIV and hepatitis C. Nevertheless\, overall mortality r
 ates from all infectious diseases has remained relatively stable.\n\nThere
  are very real concerns about new drug development’s ability to keep up 
 with development of drug resistance and the speed at which infectious dise
 ases can cross the globe.\n\nIn early 2019\, Lien Van Hoecke and Kenny Roo
 se wrote in the Journal of Translational Medicine\, “Wider accessibility
  and implementation of antibody-based therapeutics is however hindered by 
 manufacturing challenges and high development costs inherent to protein-ba
 sed drugs. For these reasons\, alternative ways are being pursued to produ
 ce and deliver antibodies more cost-effectively without hampering safety. 
 Over the past decade\, messenger RNA (mRNA) based drugs have emerged as a 
 highly appealing new class of biologics that can be used to encode any pro
 tein of interest directly in vivo.”\n\nDr. Philip J. Santangelo is a Pro
 fessor in the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering. In 
 1998\, he obtained his Ph.D. in Engineering from the University of Califor
 nia at Davis\, and then was a postdoctoral fellowship at Sandia National L
 aboratories in Livermore\, California. He also spent time as a research fa
 culty member at Georgia Tech until becoming an Assistant Professor in 2007
 . Dr. Santangelo’s research focuses on the development of imaging tools 
 for the study of viral pathogenesis and immune responses\, and the develop
 ment of mRNA-based therapies and vaccines.\n\nOn Wednesday January 29th\, 
 2020\, Dr. Santangelo will discuss his research into mRNA-based therapeuti
 cs\, what they are and how we are using them for prevention and treatment.
 \n\nIf you are interested in new approaches to preventing and treating vir
 al infection\, including synthetic mRNA and gene modulation technology wil
 l find Dr. Santangelo’s Pediatric Tech Talk of high value.\n\nLunch will

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Public\
 , Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\nStatus: draft\n\nAbstract:\n\
 nScience journalist Eva Wolfangel has specialized in investigating the eff
 ects of future technologies on society - by accompanying people who alread
 y make intensive use of these technologies today. She spent weeks under a 
 VR headset researching social virtual reality\, and she finally visited he
 r new "virtual" friends in their real lives in Kuwait\, Israel and various
  US states. These people already spend a large part of their lives in virt
 ual reality - and that is no reason for cultural pessimism. In Japan\, Wol
 fangel has accompanied researchers working on human augmentation\, and she
  has tried out many of these technologies\, met people here who are alread
 y using them and talked to many about their dream of an augmented future. 
 In this talk\, Eva Wolfangel discusses her research and how future technol
 ogies are already changing society today.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\nEva Wolfangel
  is a Knight Science Journalism Fellow at MIT. In 2018\, she was named Eur
 opean Science Writer of the Year by the Association of British Science Wri
 ters. She focuses on new technologies such as artificial intelligence and 
 virtual reality\, computer science\, data journalism\, interaction between
  digital and real worlds\, and space travel. Eva’s specialty is to combi
 ne creative writing and technical topics in order to reach a broad audienc
 e. She writes for major magazines and newspapers in Germany and Switzerlan
 d\, including Die Zeit\, Geo\, Der Spiegel\, and NZZ\, and also produces r
 adio features. As a VR journalist\, she reports from virtual worlds as par
 t of the journalistic cooperative RiffReporter [Hyperlink to: https://www.

 \, Undergraduate students\nStatus: published\n\nGA Tech Ocean Science and 
 Engineering Presents Dr. Donald R. Webster\, GA Tech School Civil and Envi
 ronmental Engineering\nUnderwater Flight of the Pteropod\n\nThe swimming c
 haracteristics achieved by flapping wings\, translating motion\, and shell
  pitching are studied from observations of shelled Antarctic pteropods (aq
 uatic snails nicknamed `sea butterfies'). A portable tomographic particle 
 image velocimetry (tomo-PIV) system was used to study these pteropods (Lim
 acina helicina antarctica) swim with a pair of parapodia (or “wings”) 
 via a unique flapping propulsion mechanism that incorporates similar techn
 iques as observed in small flying insects.\n\nThe swimming velocity is typ
 ically 14 – 30 mm/s for pteropod size ranging 1.5 – 5 mm\, and the pte
 ropod shell pitches forward-and-backward at 1.9 – 3 Hz. The pitching mot
 ion of the shell effectively positions the parapodia such that they flap d
 ownwards during both power and recovery strokes. The tomo-PIV measurements
  reveal the influence of the vortex structure created and shed from the pa
 rapodia on the generated lift forces.\n\nThe non-dimensional variables cha
 racterizing the motion of swimming pteropods are flapping\, translating\, 
 and pitching Reynolds numbers (i.e. Ref\, ReU\, and ReΩ). The observed sp
 ecimens swim within the same optimal Strouhal number range as observed for
  a broad range of species in air and water. The complex combination of bod
 y kinematics\, flow structures\, and resulting force balance may be signif
 icantly altered by thinning of the pteropod shell\, thus making pteropods 
 an indicator of the detrimental effects of ocean acidification.\n\nWebinar

  faculty search committees are required to participate in an Implicit Bias
  Workshop pursuant to Provost Bras’ memo in October 2016 to academic lea
 ders. However\, all instructional and research faculty are welcomed to att
 end as space permits.\n\nThe goals of these workshops are to increase awar
 eness of the impact of implicit bias and facilitate equitable decision-mak
 ing across myriad processes related to faculty evaluations. As a participa
 nt in the workshop\, you will learn the following:\n\n• An introduction 
 to the concept of implicit bias and how these unconscious\, automatic ment
 al processes may impact behaviors such as evaluating candidates during fac
 ulty search and/or RPT processes.\n\n• Empirical research on vitaes\, le
 tters of recommendations\, and teaching evaluations to illustrate the impa
 ct of implicit bias on decisions.\n\n• Effective practices and strategie
 s for faculty search and RPT committees.\n\nThese workshops will be facili
 tated by Paul Benkeser\, senior associate chair and professor\, Wallace H.

 ed her new "virtual" friends in their real lives in Kuwait\, Israel and va
 rious US states. These people already spend a large part of their lives in
  virtual reality - and that is no reason for cultural pessimism. In Japan\
 , Wolfangel has accompanied researchers working on human augmentation\, an
 d she has tried out many of these technologies\, met people here who are a
 lready using them and talked to many about their dream of an augmented fut
 ure. In this talk\, Eva Wolfangel discusses her research and how future te
 chnologies are already changing society today.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\nEva Wolf
 angel is a Knight Science Journalism Fellow at MIT. In 2018\, she was name

 . Lakshmi N. Sankar)\n\nwill propose a doctoral thesis entitled\,\n\nAppli
 cation of an Extended Messinger Model to Ice Accretion on Complex Geometri
 es\n\nOn\n\nFriday\, February 7 at 10:00 a.m.\nMontgomery Knight Building 
 317\n\nAbstract\nIce accretion can significantly degrade the performance a
 nd the stability of an airborne vehicle. Therefore\, it is important to mo
 del this phenomenon accurately. While researchers have conducted extensive
  ice accretion studies in the past on airplane wings and helicopter blades
 \, very few of these studies are for more complex geometries such as fusel
 ages. This work proposes a methodology that extends an existing in-house E
 xtended Messinger ice accretion solver to complex geometries on unstructur
 ed grids\, with a marching process along surface streamlines to handle thr
 ee-dimensional flow effects.\n\nThe work completed to date includes sensit
 ivity studies for ice accretion and shedding on shortened Schweizer 269 ma
 in rotor blades and two-dimensional steady and oscillating airfoil ice acc
 retion cases\, on structured grids. Towards the goal of developing unstruc
 tured grid based methodologies\, several different cases with varying leve
 ls of complexity have been completed. These include a commercial transport
  airfoil\, a three-dimensional MS(1)-317 swept wing at different angles of
  attack\, and the Robin fuselage.\n\nUnstructured grid based analyses usin
 g commercial solvers such as STAR-CCM+ and ANSYS Fluent have been used to 
 date for the flow field and water droplet dispersed phase computations. Th
 e ice accretion is carried out using an in-house analysis called GT-ICE. T
 he predictions by GT-ICE have compared to available experimental data\, an
 d to predictions by LEWICE\, an industry standard solver developed at the 
 NASA Glenn Research Center.\n\nThe proposed work includes the development 
 of an unstructured grid based Eulerian droplet trajectory and collection e
 fficiency methodology using public domain modules within OpenFOAM\, couple
 d to a surface streamline visualization and data extraction process using 
 the public domain solver ParaView. GT-ICE will be employed for ice accreti
 on computations. The new methodology is capable of handling 2D and 3D\, st
 ructured and unstructured\, steady and unsteady flow analyses.\n\nCommitte

 \nDirect Write Processing of 3D Composite Nanostructures and 2D Electronic
  Materials using Focused Beams of Molecules and Electrons\nProf. Andrei Fe
 dorov - School of Mechanical Engineering\, Georgia Tech\nAbstract: Focused
  Electron Beam Induced Processing (FEBIP) is a powerful method for atom-by
 -atom fabrication of topologically complex nanostructures from a variety o
 f materials. It has potential to provide a comprehensive processing enviro
 nment for emerging electronic and quantum devices based on 2D materials. W
 e are developing a family of multi-mode energized micro/nano-jet technique
 s for local precursor delivery to resolve the FEBID challenges and to expa
 nd the range of useful precursors from gas to liquid phase for broader FEB
 IP applications. Energized micro/nano-jets of thermally or electro-kinetic
 ally energized precursors in both gas and liquid phase provide unique capa
 bilities for localized delivery of precursor molecules to the substrate\, 
 thus establishing locally controlled deposition/etching site for FEBIP. Un
 derstanding of fascinating and interacting chemistry and physics on the mo
 st fundamental level will be discussed as a route to develop new FEBIP mod
 es and applications to emerging electronic and quantum devices based on 2D
  materials.\n\nBio: Andrei G. Fedorov is Rae S. and Frank H. Chaired Profe
 ssor in the School of Mechanical Engineering and the Petit Institute for B
 ioengineering and Biosciences at Georgia Tech. His current research focuse
 s on electron-beam-mediated nanomanufacturing\, MEMS-enabled bioanalytical
  instrumentation\, thermal management of high performance electronics\, an
 d power generation with synergetic CO2 capture. Fedorov has authored/co-au
 thored over 200 archival articles in premier technical journals. His resea
 rch has led to development of new technologies for various applications\, 
 resulting in over 40 issued US patents and pending patent applications. Fo
 r his inventions of biomedical devices\, the World Technology Network (WTN
 )\, in cooperation with AAAS Science Magazine\, CNN\, and leading technolo
 gy companies\, selected Fedorov as a WTN Associate and one of the twenty-f
 ive “most innovative people and organizations in the science and technol
 ogy world” nominated for the 2005 World Technology Award in Health and M
 edicine. He was recognized with the US National Aeronautics and Space Admi
 nistration (NASA) Invention & Contribution Board Award for development of 
 catalytic reactor technologies\, as well as multiple inventor recognition 
 awards from the Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC) and Microelectron
 ics Advanced Research Corporation (MARCO).\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatec

 , Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\nStatus: draft\n\nAbstract:\n\
 nGeorgia Tech has been at the forefront of sustainability since its incept
 ion in the 1880's. This is evidenced by the fact that the original brick b
 uildings on campus were made from indigenous Georgia red clay\, and Grant 
 Field was the home to football\, baseball and track. Fast forward to 2019 
 where we have just built the Kendeda Building for Innovative Sustainable D
 esign\, slated to be one of the most sustainable buildings in the southeas
 t\, on the path to meet the stringent requirements of the Living Building 
 Challenge. Come learn about the evolution of Georgia Tech's 400-acre ecosy
 stem and our commitment to sustainable campus development.\n\nSpeaker Bio:
 \n\nHoward Wertheimer is a Fellow in the American Institute of Architects 
 and a LEED Accredited Professional. From 2006-2019\, Howard served as the 
 AVP for Capital Planning & Space Management and Institute Architect at the
  Georgia Institute of Technology where he had strategic oversight of the C
 ampus Master Plan\, Landscape Master Plan\, Historic Preservation Plan\, c
 ampus-wide sustainability initiatives\, curation of public art\, and most 
 things visually exposed. He was responsible for the aesthetics and visual 
 vocabulary of the campus\, which currently includes over 16M square feet o
 f space in 200 buildings on 400 acres in Atlanta\, Georgia.\n\nWhile at Ge
 orgia Tech\, Howard lead the development of the Kendeda Building for Susta
 inable Design and has delivered numerous papers across the country on Geor
 gia Tech’s Living Building journey\, anticipated to be one the most envi
 ronmentally advanced education and research buildings on a university camp
 us in the Southeast.\n\nHoward is currently the Executive Vice President a
 nd Chief Operating Officer at the Piedmont Park Conservancy\, a non-profit
  overseeing the stewardship\, operations\, financial procedures\, programs
  and overall performance to cultivate substantial and sustainable growth o
 f Atlanta’s iconic Piedmont Park\, which is the heart and soul of the ci
 ty.\n\nSchedule of Brown Bag Speakers Spring 2020 [1]\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http

 Pless is a highly regarded specialty structural engineering firm founded i
 n 1964 in Atlanta. Over the past 55 years\, the firm has developed a reput
 ation for being industry leaders in the niche markets in which it has chos
 en to practice\, rather than evolving into a traditional large generalist 
 structural engineering firm. As a result of this focus\, the firm has deve
 loped specialized skills and attracted highly experienced engineers. This 
 has resulted in being called upon to execute more complex structural engin
 eering projects.\n\nThe firm has offices in multiple states in the US\, bu
 t provides specialty services across the country and internationally. Benn
 ett & Pless’ sister company BPL Enclosure Engineering provides enclosure
  and ETFE engineering throughout the US and Western Europe.\n\nLinks:\n[0]

 ly\nGraduating global citizens is one of Georgia Tech’s strategic goals\
 , yet many students don’t have the opportunity to study abroad. What are
  we doing at home to help students engage in global challenges and develop
  intercultural communication skills? In this workshop\, we invite particip
 ants to consider how integrating the United Nations Sustainable Developmen
 t Goals (SDGs) into their courses will help foster global citizenship no m
 atter where students are learning. The UN SDGs [1] are a set of 17 broad a
 nd interconnected goals that address the global challenges we face. We arg
 ue that the SDGs can be incorporated into any course regardless of discipl
 ine. Faculty members from diverse programs at Georgia Tech will share exam
 ples of how they have incorporated the SDGs into their courses. Workshop p
 articipants will have the opportunity to articulate their vision for how t
 he SDGs may work in their own course and identify (and propose) resources 
 that can help support them in realizing it.\n\nWorkshop facilitators:\n\n-

 , Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\nStatus: review\n\nAbstract:\n
 \nImagine a 1D curve\, then use it to fill a 2D manifold that covers an ar
 bitrary 3D object – this computationally intensive materials challenge h
 as been realized in the ancient technology known as knitting. This process
  for making functional materials 2D materials from 1D portable cloth dates
  back to prehistory\, with the oldest known examples dating from the 11th 
 century BCE. Knitted textiles are ubiquitous as they are easy and cheap to
  create\, lightweight\, portable\, flexible and stretchy. As with many fun
 ctional materials\, the key to knitting’s extraordinary properties lies 
 in its microstructure.\n\nAt the 1D level\, knits are composed of an inter
 locking series of slip knots. At the most basic level there is only one ma
 nipulation that creates a knitted stitch – pulling a loop of yarn throug
 h another loop. However\, there exist hundreds of books with thousands of 
 patterns of stitches with seemingly unbounded complexity.\n\nThe topology 
 of knitted stitches has a profound impact on the geometry and elasticity o
 f the resulting fabric. This puts a new spin on additive manufacturing –
  not only can stitch pattern control the local and global geometry of a te
 xtile\, but the creation process encodes mechanical properties within the 
 material itself. Unlike standard additive manufacturing techniques\, the i
 nnate properties of the yarn and the stitch microstructure has a direct ef
 fect on the global geometric and mechanical outcome of knitted fabrics.\n\
 nSpeaker Bio:\n\nElisabetta Matsumoto is an assistant professor in the Sch
 ool of Physics at Georgia Institute of Technology. Her physics research ce
 nters around the relationship between geometry and material properties in 
 soft systems\, including liquid crystals\, 3D printing and textiles. She i
 s also interested in using sewing\, 3D printing and virtual reality in mat
 hematical art and education. She is the recipient of an NSF CAREER award. 
 She studied physics at the University of Pennsylvania\, earning her BA and
  MS in 2007 and her PhD in 2011. She has been knitting and crochet since s
 he was about 12 and has been sewing for longer than she can remember.\n\nS

 \, Public\nExtras: Free food\nStatus: published\n\nThe Meg & Sam Flax Lect
 ure Series on Public Policy Presents: Prof. Richard Barke Associate Profes
 sor in the School of Public Policy FOOD & BEVERAGES PROVIDED ● Why don
 ’t policymakers take expert scientific advise more seriously?\n● How d
 oes S&T expertise get into the policy process?\n● Can a good scientist o
 r engineer be a good policymaker?\n● What strategies and tactics can Tec
 h students and alumni use to have more impact?\n\nAfter graduating from Ge
 orgia Tech (Physics)\, Professor Barke earned a Ph.D. in Political Science
  from the University of Rochester. He has advised agencies in the U.S. and
  abroad\, the U.S. Congress\, and companies on how to incorporate expert s
 cientific advice into public policy. In this lecture\, he shares what he h
 as learned over the years about the effectiveness of scientists in politic
 al arenas. Examples include cases from FDA\, EPA\, FCC\, NASA\, and the U.
 S. Congress. Professor Barke’s research focuses on the roles of politics
  within science and of science within politics\, and the regulation of ris
 k (particularly the FDA). Dr. Barke has written about topics such as the p
 olitical behavior of scientific disciplines\, the politics of science budg
 eting in Congress\, and how scientists translate scientific findings into 
 policy recommendations. Recent works involve the decision making processes
  by which science and ethics are reconciled in the regulation of research\
 , particularly research involving human subjects and in nanotechnology. Cu
 rrently he is writing a book about political\, cognitive\, and economic ob
 stacles to long-term policy making.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.edu/n

 , Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\nStatus: draft\n\nAbstract:\n\
 nThere is increasing excitement about reinforcement learning--a subarea of
  machine learning for enabling an agent to learn to make good decisions. Y
 et numerous questions and challenges remain for reinforcement learning to 
 help support progress in applications that involve interacting with people
 \, like education\, consumer marketing and healthcare. I will discuss our 
 work on some of the technical challenges that arise in this pursuit\, incl
 uding sample efficiency\, counterfactual reasoning\, robustness\, and appl
 ications to health and education.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\nEmma Brunskill is an 
 assistant professor in the Computer Science Department at Stanford Univers
 ity where she leads the AI for Human Impact group. Her work focuses on rei
 nforcement learning in high stakes scenarios--how can an agent learn from 
 experience to make good decisions when experience is costly or risky\, suc
 h as in educational software\, healthcare decision making\, or people-faci
 ng applications. She was previously a professor at Carnegie Mellon Univers
 ity. She is the recipient of multiple early faculty career awards (Nationa
 l Science Foundation\, Office of Naval Research\, Microsoft Research) and 
 her group has received several best research paper nominations (CHI\, EDMx
 3) and awards (UAI\, RLDM).\n\nSchedule of Brown Bag Speakers Spring 2020

 , Undergraduate students\nStatus: published\n\nmy PhD thesis titled "Impor
 tance of Manganese oxides in carbon remineralization in river-dominated co
 ntinental margins and the biogeochemical cycling of arsenic" on February 2
 7th at 1 pm in Ford EST L1114. My committee members include Dr. Martial Ta
 illefert (advisor\, GT EAS)\, Dr. Yuanzhi Tang (GT\, EAS) Dr. Thomas DiChr
 istina (GT\, BIO)\, Dr. Frank Stewart (Montana State University)\, Dr. Geo
 rge Luther (Univ. of Delaware)\, and Dr. Christophe Rabouille (Univ d'Sacl
 ay\, CEA\, LSCE\, France). My abstract is included below.\n\nBest regards\
 ,\n\nShannon Owings\n\nManganese oxides (MnO2) are ubiquitous in the envir
 onment and play an important role in the transformation and transport of c
 ontaminants in the environment in addition to play a major role in the bio
 geochemical cycling of carbon. This study investigated both aspects of the
 se roles using a combination of laboratory experiments and field work. Fir
 st\, the kinetics of oxidation of the more toxic arsenic form\, arsenite (
 As(III))\, to the less mobile form\, arsenate (As(V))\, by MnO2 was determ
 ined and compared to literature data to investigate the mechanism of the r
 eaction. Subsequently\, the effect of low As(V) concentrations on the anae
 robic microbial respiration of MnO2 and iron oxides\, Fe(OH)3\, were inves
 tigated to shed light into the mechanism of As(V) toxicity in aquatic envi
 ronments. At low As(V) concentrations\, microbial reduction rates were inc
 reased compared to arsenic-free treatments suggesting As(V) at low concent
 rations stimulates metal reduction (MnO2\, Fe(OH)3) in sediments as a resu
 lt of a catalytic cycle in which arsenic is constantly reduced via microbi
 al detoxification and re-oxidized by MnO2. The cumulative findings from th
 is study suggest that arsenic is not simply immobilized in sediments and t
 hat a suite of complex abiotic and microbial processes including adsorptio
 n\, intracellular transport\, and redox reactions may affect the transport
  of arsenic in the environment\, and ultimately the quality of drinking wa
 ter resources.\n\nIn parallel to laboratory experiments\, manganese cyclin
 g\, and the dominant redox pathways involved in carbon remineralization pr
 ocesses were characterized in marine sediments across the Louisiana shelf 
 and slope that are exposed to mineral and terrestrial organic inputs from 
 the Mississippi River. Although sulfate reduction dominates on the contine
 ntal shelf\, denitrification and microbial manganese reduction appear equa
 lly significant anaerobic respiration processes along the continental slop
 e the closest to the Mississippi River. This study emphasizes how the diff
 erential oxidation kinetics of Mn2+ (slow) and Fe2+ (fast) as well as sedi
 ment transport processes influence the main pathways of carbon degradation
  in these regions. Overall this thesis emphasizes the importance of charac
 terizing the fundamental molecular processes of complex systems to better 
 understand large scale global biogeochemical cycles.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http:

 \nOptimization over the Diffeomorphism Group Using Riemannian BFGS with Ap
 plication\nAbstract. The set of diffeomorphisms of the unit interval\, or 
 “warping functions\,” plays an important role in many in functional da
 ta analysis applications. Most prominently\, the problem of registering\, 
 or aligning\, pairs of functions depends on solving for an element of the 
 diffeomorphism group that\, when applied to one function\, optimally align
 s it to the other. The registration problem is posed as the unconstrained 
 minimization of a cost function over the infinite dimensional diffeomorphi
 sm function space. We make use of its well-known Riemannian geometry – t
 he positive orthant of the unit Hilbert sphere under the L2 metric – to 
 implement an efficient\, limited memory Riemannian BFGS optimization schem
 e. We compare performance and results to the benchmark algorithm\, Dynamic
  Programming\, on several functional datasets. Additionally\, we apply our
  methodology to the problem of non-parametric density estimation and compa
 re to the benchmark performance of MATLAB’s built-in kernel density esti
 mator ‘ksdensity’.\n\nBiography.\n\nDarshan Bryner received his B.S. d
 egree in Applied Mathematics in 2007 and his M.S. degree in Mathematics in
  2008\, both from Georgia Institute of Technology. In 2008\, he joined the
  Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) as a researc
 h scientist. While employed at NSWC PCD\, in 2010 he began work on his Ph.
 D. degree in Statistics at Florida State University and graduated in 2013.
  Under the co-advisement of Dr. Anuj Srivastava and Dr. Eric Klassen\, his
  thesis was on developing affine invariant\, elastic shape models to use a
 s prior distributions in a Bayesian active contour method for sonar image 
 segmentation. Dr. Bryner continues his research at NSWC PCD in a variety o
 f areas including Riemannian geometry and manifold optimization\, Bayesian
  inference in spatial statistics\, and bioinformatics. Since 2017\, Dr. Br
 yner has served as the head of the Advanced Signal Processing and Automati
 c Target Recognition Branch (Code X23) within the Science and Technology D
 epartment at NSWC PCD.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.edu/node/632525#0\

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Postdoc\nStatus: published\
 n\nPlease register [1] to attend this upcoming teaching with technology wo
 rkshop!\n\nEvery semester we engage Georgia Tech students in a variety of 
 assessment experiences that are intended to determine what they have learn
 ed. For a number of these students\, however\, our assessments fall short 
 of their goal. Whether it’s due to language differences or to the fact t
 hat their brains are wired differently\, many students don’t get a chanc
 e to fully demonstrate what they know—and we don’t get a chance to fin
 d out the impact of our teaching.\n\nHow common is this experience? It may
  surprise you to learn that neurodivergent-related accommodations are now 
 the most frequent accommodation type at Georgia Tech. Regardless of whethe
 r you’re teaching to the highly diverse student population of an online 
 at-scale course or you’re teaching a small class of residential students
 \, you are likely to encounter students who require more diversity in asse
 ssment if you want to truly evaluate their learning experience.\n\nAlthoug
 h the thought of providing multiple types of assessments can be overwhelmi
 ng\, technology can be a great help. In this workshop\, we will explore a 
 variety of technologies such as Gradescope and Kaltura that will make it e
 asier for you to create\, collect\, and provide feedback on assessments th
 at allow for multiple means of action and expression. We will discuss how 
 the principles of Universal Design for Learning (UDL) can aid us in creati
 ng assessments that allow every student to demonstrate their learning. And
  we will hear from hear from Anne Jannarone\, Assistant Dean and Director 
 of the Office of Disability Services\, about neurodivergent students at Ge
 orgia Tech and what resources are available to you.\n\nJoin us and learn f
 irst-hand about multiple means of assessment and the technologies that mak
 e this process possible. Bring your laptop to explore examples during hand
 s-on activities\, or simply follow along with someone at your table. Wheth
 er you’re teaching large diverse populations in the online OMS program o
 r an array of students in a face-to-face course on campus\, there are ways
  that both you and your students can benefit from multiple means of assess
 ment. We look forward to seeing you at the workshop!\n\nLunch will be prov
 ided. Please register [1] [2] to join us!\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech

 re interested in attending any of the sessions\, please review the below i
 nformation and register online.\n\nUnstructured Manufacturing\nGary McMurr
 ay\n\nRobotic systems have been very successful in performing tasks where 
 the inputs are well defined and known in advance. Automotive and electroni
 c manufacturing are the classic success stories where robotic systems have
  demonstrated incredible value for the industry. In unstructured manufactu
 ring\, the inputs of the system can vary significantly\, but the outputs o
 f the system are defined. Food and agriculture production are examples of 
 this type of unstructured manufacturing problem\, but traditional manufact
 uring is also moving in this direction as robotics move beyond welding and
  painting. This presentation will give examples of systems that integrate 
 advanced perception and control technologies into robotic systems to perfo
 rm complex tasks like cutting\, grasping\, and manipulation of objects in 
 an unstructured environment.\n\nRegister Online for upcoming SCL IRC semin
 ars [1]\n\nAttendance to the sessions is complimentary for SCL corporate p
 artners\, SCL Industry Advisory Board members\, SCL affiliated faculty and
  students\, and students enrolled in the Masters in Supply Chain Engineeri

 l PCR provides absolute quantification of target DNA or RNA without the ne
 ed for a standard curve\, providing orders of magnitude greater precision 
 and sensitivity than real-time PCR. By partitioning reactions into droplet
 s using the QX200 Droplet Digital PCR system\, researchers can now:\n\n- D
 ifferentiate germline copy number variations (CNV)\n- Accurately quantify 
 rare alleles in an excess of wildtype background DNA\n- Precisely quantita
 te nucleic acids\n- Analyze miRNA expression\n- Quantify single cell gene 
 expression\n- Identify positive genome edited clones\n\nSee how the QX200 
 Droplet Digital PCR System enables exploration of complex genetic landscap
 es\, discovers and validates new disease associations\, and redefines a ne
 w era of molecular research.\n\nPlease RSVP (before March 20\, 2020) for l

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Postdoc
 \, Public\, Undergraduate students\nStatus: published\n\nThis event is gen
 erously sponsored by the Georgia Tech College of Design and the Center for
  Computing and Societies.\n\nBackground\nUrban Analytics (UA) and Smart Ci
 ties (SC) research and degree programs are becoming more common in the U.S
 . and globally. UA and SC research has helped developed powerful technique
 s for spatial data creation\, capture and analysis and has drawn talented 
 individuals to this research.\n\nYet\, these programs and research agendas
  often operate without an explicit ‘plan’ for how technology and data 
 analysis will tackle real world issues. Because these fields are founded w
 ith technocratic and engineering problem-solving ideals (values inherent t
 o analytics and ‘smart’ endeavors)\, research questions and execution 
 in this field may be need re-definition and intervention if they are to he
 lp cities reach the most vulnerable citizens and improve daily life. Resea
 rch and thought leadership in UA and SC should include the voices and inpu
 t of the typical urbanite and those most in need. This field also should d
 eeply consider how different perspectives on race\, ethnicity\, gender\, s
 exual-orientation\, disability and poverty status (and more) may add cruci
 al variables to the study of urban analytics.\n\nResearch Contribution\nWe
  will be generating solutions for how our research and teaching can includ
 e a more diverse body of tacit knowledge from the urban community and how 
 can we solve real-life problems with data analytics. We will be developing
  strategies and recommending formal research frameworks (mixed-method\, mu
 lti-scale\, validating-by-interview\, etc.) to guide UA and SC research to
 wards championing citizen voices and helping people. Our goal is to empowe
 r UA students and researchers to shape urban research questions\, methodol
 ogies and implementation in way that positively impacts the city and its p
 eople.\n\nWe will have meaningful conversations and develop a guiding agen
 da that can serve as an ‘intervention’ that is needed as UA and SC fie
 lds mature. Without this discussion\, these fields may not adopt the kinds
  of sensitivities towards diversity\, inclusion and the human experience\,
  that it needs to best serve the people. The agenda will help put forth:\n
 \n- A plan to put crucial information into the hands of the city’s most 
 vulnerable populations.\n- Methods for using technology to collect data on
  spatial behaviors in a safe\, privacy-securing way\, and using the inform
 ation to optimize locations of services and facilities.\n- Designs for tec
 h education for disadvantaged and underrepresented populations at multiple
  levels.\n- Methods to identify which small changes can have the biggest i
 mpact.\n- How to listen to and learn from citizens who need help and have

 ound\nUrban Analytics (UA) and Smart Cities (SC) degree programs are becom
 ing more common in the U.S. and globally. Often\, these programs don’t h
 ave a ‘plan’ for how technology and data analysis will tackle real wor
 ld issues\, or an understanding of how different perspectives on race\, et
 hnicity\, gender\, sexual-orientation\, disability and poverty status (and
  more) may add crucial variables to the study of urban analytics.\n\nAltho
 ugh the UA field is data-rich\, the questions and studies in this field ma
 y be ill-suited for helping cities reach the most vulnerable citizens\, or
  how to best empower UA students to positively impact to the city and its 
 people. Because these fields were founded with technocratic and engineerin
 g problem-solving ideals (values inherent to analytics and ‘smart’ end
 eavors)\, the research and thought leadership in UA ad SC lacks the voices
  and input of the typical urbanite and those most in need\, although it co
 ntributes powerful methods and draws talent.\n\nResearch Contribution\nWe 
 will be generating solutions for how our research and teaching can include
  a more diverse body of tacit knowledge from the urban community and how c
 an we solve real-life problems with data analytics? We will be developing 
 strategies and recommending formal research frameworks (mixed-method\, mul
 ti-scale\, validating-by-interview\, etc.) to guide UA and SC research tow
 ards championing citizen voices and helping people.\n\nOur task is to have
  meaningful conversations and develop a guiding agenda that can serve as a
 n ‘intervention’ that is needed as UA and SC fields mature. Without th
 is discussion\, these fields may not adopt the kinds of sensitivities towa
 rds diversity\, inclusion and the human experience\, that it needs to best
  serve the people. The agenda will help put forth:\n\n- A plan to put cruc
 ial information into the hands of the city’s most vulnerable populations
 .\n\n- Methods for using technology to collect data on spatial behaviors i
 n a safe\, privacy-securing way\, and using the information to optimize lo
 cations of services and facilities.\n\n- Designs for tech education for di
 sadvantaged and underrepresented populations at multiple levels.\n\n- How 
 to listen to and learn from citizens who need help and have first-hand per
 spectives (i.e. tacit knowledge) on the urban ecosystem.\n\n- Open ended d
 iscussion on how to connect urban analytics to common-sense urban problems

 ve been very successful in performing tasks where the inputs are well defi
 ned and known in advance. Automotive and electronic manufacturing are the 
 classic success stories where robotic systems have demonstrated incredible
  value for the industry. In unstructured manufacturing\, the inputs of the
  system can vary significantly\, but the outputs of the system are defined
 . Food and agriculture production are examples of this type of unstructure
 d manufacturing problem\, but traditional manufacturing is also moving in 
 this direction as robotics move beyond welding and painting. This presenta
 tion will give examples of systems that integrate advanced perception and 
 control technologies into robotic systems to perform complex tasks like cu
 tting\, grasping\, and manipulation of objects in an unstructured environm

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Postdoc
 \, Public\, Undergraduate students\nStatus: published\n\nGordana Vunjak-No
 vakovic\, Ph.D.\nUniversity Professor\nThe Mikati Foundation Professor of 
 Biomedical Engineering and Medicine\nDirector\, Laboratory for Stem Cells 
 and Tissue Engineering\nColumbia University\n\nApproximately 35 million me
 n and women in the United States suffer from TMJ problems\, and as many as
  one in four people experience symptoms of TMJ disorders\, including pain 
 in the chewing muscles\, jaw stiffness\, clicking\, popping or grating\, o
 r the pain of arthritis. The temporomandibular joint\, or TMJ\, is the jaw
  joint that lies in front of each ear\, connecting the mandible (lower jaw
 ) to the skull\, providing the mobility necessary for biting\, chewing\, s
 wallowing food\, speaking\, and making facial expressions.\n\nGordana Vunj
 ak-Novakovic and her research team have been able to grow bone grafts that
  will match a patient’s original jaw bone for facial reconstruction surg
 ery to repair injuries\, disease\, or birth defects. This spectacular adva
 ncement in bone tissue engineering provides all the advantages of the body
 ’s original jaw bone. The team used real bone as a scaffold to grow the 
 new TMJ graft. Taking the knee joints of calves\, they stripped them of al
 l their living cells and carved them into cubic centimeter-size parts of a
  human jaw joint.\n\nUsing mesenchymal stem cells\, which can differentiat
 e into many cell types\, to seed the scaffolding\, they fed them with stre
 ams of nutrients\, growth factors\, and oxygen in a bioreactor. The next s
 tep will be to determine the best way to grow blood vessels in the bone gr
 afts to continue their viability.\n\nIn another research area\, Vunjak-Nov
 akovic is engineering thick\, vascularized\, and electromechanically funct
 ional cardiac tissue\, by culturing stem cells\, the actual “tissue engi
 neers\,” on a channeled elastomer scaffold perfused with culture medium 
 containing oxygen carriers\, to mimic blood flow. This research may lead t
 o a heart patch that could be laid over injured heart tissue to restore no
 rmal function in someone who has suffered a heart attack.\n\n“As a biome
 dical engineer actively involved in this field\, I look forward to unlocki
 ng the full regenerative potential of human stem cells\, so we can cure di
 sease and live longer than our failing organs\,” she said.\n\nHer lab ho
 sts the Bioreactor Core of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Tissue 
 Engineering Resource Center. “This sophisticated bioreactor and imaging 
 instrumentation has moved stem cell research from the ‘flat biology’ o
 f petri dishes to controllable models of high biological fidelity\, which 
 can be studied in real time to observe the interacting factors mediating s
 elf-renewal and differentiation of stem cells\,” said Vunjak-Novakovic. 
 “We now have the capacity to develop entirely new research paradigms and
  approaches to engineering human tissues.”\n\nIn 2002\, Vunjak-Novakovic
  was elected a fellow of the American Institute for Medical and Biological
  Engineering. In 2007\, she gave the Director’s lecture at the NIH\, as 
 the first woman engineer to receive this distinction. She was inducted int
 o the Women in Technology International Hall of Fame in 2008\, elected to 
 the New York Academy of Sciences in 2009\, and\, in 2010\, received the Cl
 emson Award of the Biomaterials Society for contribution to literature.\n\
