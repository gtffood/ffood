 ree food\nStatus: published\n\nABSTRACT\n\nIn a crystal with only one atom
  per unit cell\, all atoms play the same role in producing the solid's glo
 bal response to external perturbations. Disordered materials are not simil
 arly constrained and a new principle emerges: independence of bond-level r
 esponse. This allows one to drive the system to different regimes of behav
 ior by successively removing individual bonds. We can thus exploit disorde
 r to achieve unique\, varied\, textured and tunable global response or lon
 g-range interactions inspired by allosteric behavior in proteins. While th
 is approach is successful for systems with only a few degrees of freedom\,
  it is difficult to scale up the number of elements to be controlled or sc
 ale down the size of the individual components. However\, because a materi
 al has a memory of under what conditions it has been aged\, we can direct 
 the aging using Nature’s greedy algorithms to achieve a variety of mecha
 nical functionalities.\n\nABOUT THE SPEAKER\n\nSidney Nagel is the Stein-F
 reiler Distinguished Service Professor of Physics for the Department of Ph
 ysics\, James Franck Institute and Enrico Fermi Institute at the Universit
 y of Chicago. He obtained a BA degree from Columbia University\, MA degree
  in Physics and a PhD degree in Physics from Princeton University. His act

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Postdoc
 \nExtras: Free food\nStatus: published\n\nHow do your grading practices im
 pact your students? Research shows that not all grading practices motivate
  student learning. In fact\, some practices have the opposite effect. For 
 example\, grade curving: did you know grade curving demotivates students? 
 Goergia Tech students have said that grade curving promotes stress\, cheat
 ing\, competition\, and even apathy Students feel there is little room to 
 ever fail and that if they do\, their grade is unlikely to recover. Additi
 onally\, feedback regarding the curve does not come in early enough for st
 udents to determine whether or not they should drop the class.\n\nWhile cu
 rving is a common problematic grading practice\, it isn’t the only one. 
 However\, equitable grading practices that are mathematically accurate\, r
 esistant to bias\, and motivating to students to achieve academic growth a
 nd success can refocus students on learning\, not just the grade. Many ins
 tructors wish to apply these principles in their teaching\, but it can be 
 difficult to determine how to do so\, leaving faculty to wonder how to be 
 both fair and rigorous when grading.\n\nThese topics will be further explo
 red in the Center for Teaching and Learning workshop\, Grading: Are Both E
 quity and Rigor Possible? Participants will ponder common grading approach
 es through the lens of equity to identify opportunities to restore some co
 mpassion to the grading process while still using grades to accurately ref
 lect student learning. The primary goals of the workshop are to help instr
 uctors to consider why they use their grading style compared to available 
 alternatives\, understand grades in the context of how they affect the mot
 ivation\, learning\, and well-being of their students\, and develop an awa
 reness of equitable versus non-equitable grading strategies.\n\nJoin us [1

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Graduate students\, Undergraduate students\
 nExtras: Free food\, Freebies\nStatus: published\n\nJoin us at 6:30pm in K
 laus 1116EW to hear from several of Equifax’s women leaders who have com
 e to security from different educational backgrounds\, former careers\, an
 d interests\, but who share a passion for challenging work\, career growth
 \, and personal excellence. Learn about their career journeys that led the
 m to security\, how they apply their interests and training to their curre
 nt work and future professional goals\, and hear the advice they have for 
 the next generation of women in security.\n\nPanelists:\n• Meghan Caputo
 \, Director\, Global Crisis Management\n\n• Diana Dudas\, Director\, Sec
 urity Risk\n\n• Courtney Healey\, Senior Director\, Security Awareness\n
 \n• Jamila Ramsay\, Senior Director\, Enterprise Application\, Security 
 and Analysis & Metrics Reporting\n\nThe terms security and cybersecurity a
 re often used interchangeably referring to the profession narrowly defined
  as a team of professionals who leverage technologies and processes to def
 end an organization’s systems and networks from attack. However\, this n
 arrow use of security sells the field short – there are in fact a number
  of key functions under the security umbrella\, one of which is cybersecur
 ity\, all of which are essential to the success of the organization. Some 
 such functions are: physical security\, fraud prevention\, privacy\, busin
 ess continuity\, disaster recovery\, and risk management\, although there 
 are still more. And though the security field is defined by the technical 
 “hacker” persona\, people with backgrounds\, skills\, and interests of
  a wide variety have all found success under the umbrella of work in the s
 ecurity field.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.edu/node/627447#0

SUMMARY:GVU Center Brown Bag: Yanni Loukissas "All Data Are Local: Thinkin
 g Critically in a Data-Driven Society"

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Public\
 , Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\nStatus: published\n\nAbstract
 :\n\nIn our data-driven society\, it is too easy to assume the transparenc
 y of data. Instead\, Yanni Loukissas argues in All Data Are Local\, we sho
 uld approach data sets with an awareness that data are created by humans a
 nd their dutiful machines\, at a time\, in a place\, with the instruments 
 at hand\, for audiences that are conditioned to receive them. The term dat
 a set implies something discrete\, complete\, and portable\, but it is non
 e of those things. Examining a series of data sources important for unders
 tanding the state of public life in the United States—Harvard's Arnold A
 rboretum\, the Digital Public Library of America\, UCLA's Television News 
 Archive\, and the real estate marketplace Zillow—Loukissas shows us how 
 to analyze data settings rather than data sets.\n\nLoukissas sets out six 
 principles: all data are local\; data have complex attachments to place\; 
 data are collected from heterogeneous sources\; data and algorithms are in
 extricably entangled\; interfaces recontextualize data\; and data are inde
 xes to local knowledge. He then provides a set of practical guidelines to 
 follow. To make his argument\, Loukissas employs a combination of qualitat
 ive research on data cultures and exploratory data visualizations. Rebutti
 ng the “myth of digital universalism\,” Loukissas reminds us of the me
 aning-making power of the local.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\nYanni Alexander Loukis
 sas is an Assistant Professor of Digital Media in the School of Literature
 \, Media\, and Communication at Georgia Tech\, where he directs the Local 
 Data Design Lab. His research is focused on helping creative people think 
 critically about the social implications of emerging technologies. His new
  monograph from MIT Press\, All Data Are Local: Thinking Critically in a D
 ata-Driven Society\, is addressed to a growing audience of practitioners w
 ho want to work with unfamiliar data both effectively and ethically. Origi
 nally trained as an architect at Cornell\, he subsequently attended MIT\, 
 where he received a Master of Science and a PhD in Design and Computation 
 and completed postdoctoral work at the Program in Science\, Technology and
  Society.\n\nSchedule of Brown Bag Speakers Fall 2019 [1]\n\nLinks:\n[0]

 r Coatings”\n\nMichael Thouless\, Ph.D.\nProfessor\, Mechanical Engineer
 ing\nProfessor\, Materials Science and Engineering\nArthur F. Thurnau Prof
 essor\, Mechanical Engineering\nJanine Johnson Weins Professor\n\nThe firs
 t concept that will be explored in this talk is the time-dependent nature 
 of cracking in polymeric coatings\, with a particular interest in the coat
 ings for automotive polymeric glazing. Experiments suggest that crack velo
 cities in these particular systems\, while sensitive to visco-elastic prop
 erties\, are controlled by kinetic processes.\nThe second topic will addre
 ss the adhesion of ice to polymeric coatings. In particular\, the work ill
 ustrates the dual role that both interfacial strength and interfacial toug
 hness play in determining the conditions for delamination. Experimental st
 udies show that the force required to delaminate a layer of ice from a pol
 ymeric coating depends on the scale of the problem.\n\n“Collecting Long-

 pen up new possibilities to collect long-range genetic and epigenetic info
 rmation at the single-molecule level. Three platforms from PacBio\, Oxford
  Nanopore Technologies\, and Bionano Genomics will be surveyed\, exploring
  their potentials and limitations. In particular\, PacBio sequencing has b
 een successfully used for mapping in eukaryotic cells the distribution of 
 N6-methyladenine (6mA)\, a DNA base modification. The sequencing results s
 upport 6mA as a transcription-associated epigenetic mark\, and suggest a m
 olecular mechanism for its maintenance after DNA replication.\n\nPizza wil

 \nProf. John Rogers - Depts. of Materials Science and Engineering\, Biomed
 ical Engineering and Medicine\; Northwestern University\nAbstract: A remar
 kable feature of modern integrated circuit technology is its ability to op
 erate in a stable fashion\, with almost perfect reliability\, without phys
 ical or chemical change. Recently developed classes of electronic material
 s create an opportunity to engineer the opposite outcome\, in the form of 
 ‘transient’ devices that dissolve\, disintegrate or otherwise disappea
 r at triggered times or with controlled rates. Water-soluble transient ele
 ctronics serve as the foundations for interesting applications in zero-imp
 act environmental monitors\, 'green' consumer electronics and bio-resorbab
 le biomedical implants. This presentation describes the foundational conce
 pts in chemistry\, materials science and assembly processes for bioresorba
 ble electronics in 1D\, 2D and 3D architectures. Wireless sensors of intra
 cranial temperature\, pressure and electrophysiology designed for use in t
 reatment of traumatic brain injury and nerve stimulators configured for ac
 celerated neuroregeneration provide application examples.\n\nBio: John A. 
 Rogers is the Louis Simpson and Kimberly Querrey Professor of Materials Sc
 ience and Engineering\, Biomedical Engineering and Medicine at Northwester
 n University\, with affiliate appointments in Mechanical Engineering\, Ele
 ctrical and Computer Engineering and Chemistry\, where he is also Director
  of the newly endowed Center for Bio-Integrated Electronics. He has publis
 hed more than 650 papers\, is a co-inventor on more than 100 patents and h
 e has co-founded several successful technology companies. His research has
  been recognized by many awards\, including a MacArthur Fellowship (2009)\
 , the Lemelson-MIT Prize (2011)\, and the Smithsonian Award for American I

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Public\
 , Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\nStatus: published\n\nAbstract
 :\n\nWalt Disney is described variously as an American entrepreneur\, a fi
 lm producer\, a pioneer of the American animation industry\, the founder o
 f the theme park industry. Public perception of him is of a filmmaker with
  an uncanny ability to create entertaining family oriented animated films 
 and experiences. More than that Walt Disney was a visionary who believed t
 echnology should be pushed to its limits to realize stories\, provide expe
 riences\, and build worlds. That a technology did not exist or was not yet
  ready to solve a problem was not an obstacle – his answer was always 
 – build it.\n\nDisney Stories: Getting to Digital (Lee & Madej\, 2012) d
 iscusses how Walt Disney and then the Walt Disney Company narratives evolv
 ed from traditional animation to computer games and online narrative exper
 iences. In the upcoming second edition (January 2020) I look at technology
  as it has been used to enhance story from the first feature animation Sno
 w White and the Seven Dwarfs to the first VR short Cycles. This talk first
  provides an overview of the technological innovation that has driven the 
 many arms of the Disney empire\, most recently the animatronics for the ne
 w Star Wars worlds at Walt Disney World and Disneyland. This is followed b
 y a presentation of Disney advances in technology made in the genre of ani
 mated films from the 1940s to today as Disney moved from the traditional m
 ethods of integrating animation and live action in Song of the South and l
 ater Mary Poppins\, to CGI assisted films beginning with Tron\, through ma
 ny iterations to Big Hero Six\, and finally to VR and its use in shorts su
 ch as Styles.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\nKrystina Madej is Professor of Practice a
 t Georgia Tech\, Atlanta\, where she has taught since 2011. Her research i
 nterests are play and games\, interactivity and collaboration in social me
 dia\, material culture of media\, and narrative across media. In particula
 r she looks at children’s traditional and digital games\, play and narra
 tives in social media and Disney’s approach to narrative and technology.
  Her research has resulted in a number of books including Physical Play an
 d Children’s Digital Games (2016)\, Interactivity\, Collaboration\, and 
 Authoring in Social Media (2015)\, and Disney Stories: Getting to Digital 
 (2012). She has been visiting professor and taught courses in Narrative at
  the Center for Digital Media in Vancouver\, Canada\, and in Children’s 
 Games\, Disney Animation\, and Design Thinking at the University of Lower 
 Silesia in Wroclaw\, Poland (both for the Erasmus program and the Masters 
 in Big Data\, Digital Media\, and Trendwatching ). Dr. Madej’s first int
 erest was in Fine Arts: she received her BFA from Concordia University in 
 Montreal\, Canada. She went on to a career as a design strategist and part
 nered with a colleague to start the first Industrial Design and Communicat
 ions business in western Canada that used computer technologies for the de
 sign and production of products\, graphics\, and exhibits. She later retur
 ned to academia and completed her doctoral studies in Digital Narrative at
  the School of Interactive Art and Technology\, SFU\, Vancouver\, Canada.\

 \, Public\, Undergraduate students\nStatus: published\n\nIn 2016\, Georgia
  Tech collected preliminary data through an online survey of 771 students.
  The report found that 10% of Georgia Tech’s students responded being in
  need of food assistance and that 16% prioritized working at their job ove
 r academics and extracurricular activities. Georgia Tech’s actions to fi
 ll this gap include opening Klemis Kitchen in 2015\, an on-campus food pan
 try that provides leftover food from the dining halls and Panera Bread as 
 well as canned donations from other sources. However\, in Spring 2019\, on
 ly 100 students have self-identified and enrolled in the program\; a far c
 ry from the 10% of students estimated in the 2016 survey.\n\nTo ensure bot
 h the highest levels of health and academic performance of all GT students
 \, we need to understand the effects of food insecurity/security on health
  and academic performance\, identify effective methods of recognizing stud
 ents who are food insecure\, and develop interventions to that will increa
 se food security among those students who are food insecure. The purpose o
 f this preliminary study is to address the first two issues. Our specific 
 aims are 1) to understand the impact of food security/insecurity on academ
 ic performance and 2) identify passive tools that can predict profiles of 
 food insecure students that are specific to students within a semester per
 iod.\n\nModerators:\n\nJon Sanford\, Professor\, School of Industrial Desi

 ghtweight Composites\nBrina Blinzler\, Assistant Professor Division of Mat
 erial and Computational Mechanics\, Department of Industrial and Materials
  Science Chalmers University of Technology\, Göteborg\, Sweden\n\nAbstrac
 t\n\nHigh performance polymer matrix composites (PMC) have a high specific
  stiffness and can be used to easily manufacture highly complex components
 . Hierarchical composite materials with microstructures designed for speci
 fic multifunctional purposes are an important development area for modern 
 materials. The demand for new materials is increasing and the rate at whic
 h those new materials should complete the development cycle is decreasing.
  In order to meet this demand\, existing material development frameworks m
 ust be enhanced via more progressive human-computer materials development.
  A few techniques are presented to meet this need including: a combination
  of modern imaging techniques and finite element analysis of in-situ fiber
  bundles\, a stochastic approach utilizing experimental through-thickness 
 scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of nanocomposites to create virt
 ual representations of the experimental microstructure\, an adaptation of 
 hierarchical materials developed in nature\, and the potential for a low e
 nergy\, high performance processing methods.\n\nBiography\n\nDr. Brina Bli
 nzler is an Assistant Professor in Composite Mechanics at Chalmers Univers
 ity of Technology. Her research focuses on composite process modeling\, me
 chanics\, and material informatics. She leads the all Wood Composites Plat
 form and is a representative for the Chalmers Graphene Center in the Focus
  Area: Multifunctional Composites and Coatings. She has recently received 
 the Jacob Wallenbergs Foundation: Material Science Research Award (2019) a
 nd the Hasselblad Foundation: Female Scientist Award (2018). Previously\, 
 Dr. Blinzler conducted research at Scaled Composites\, Easton Baseball/ So
 ftball and other companies. In addition\, she was a recipient of the NASA 
 Graduate Student Researchers Program fellowship\, holds a PhD in Civil Eng
 ineering from the University of Akron and BS in Civil Engineering from Mis
 souri University of Science and Technology.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gate

 assistant. Thanks to the technology behind Eno\, it is always improving an
 d becoming more intelligent over time. With Eno\, regardless of channel\, 
 customers are able to get their questions answered digitally and quickly.\

 obility (CURAM)\n\nPizza Provided\nOver the past two years\, the term "urb
 an air mobility (UAM)" has entered the vernacular of the aerospace industr
 y. Silicon Valley unicorns\, individual billionaires\, startup companies\,
  automotive firms\, and traditional aerospace manufacturers worldwide are 
 investing in the development of over 200 electric vertical takeoff and lan
 ding (eVTOL) aircraft to serve the UAM market. Often called "flying cars" 
 or "air taxis\," these aircraft designs are novel\, incorporating many new
  technologies. We are entering only the early days of UAM\, an era of grea
 t uncertainty. No one understands whether and how the market will emerge. 
 No one understands how eVTOL aircraft will be certified. No one understand
 s how to manage the airspace in cities when filled with air taxis. No one 
 understands how cities will regulate "vertiports" where aircraft will land
  to embark and disembark passengers. No one understands which aircraft des
 igns will "win" and how the best design varies city to city. In this era o
 f uncertainty\, there is great opportunity\, and there is great risk. This
  talk will provide an introduction to the current landscape of urban air m
 obility\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.edu/node/628104#0

 :\n\nLook around at some of the familiar objects and materials in your sur
 roundings. These things can be transformed. By combining everyday material
 s with computing\, we can extend and reimagine their expressive and functi
 onal possibilities. We can also invite people to explore a new design spac
 e through making. In this talk\, HyunJoo will present her recent work in i
 ntegrating paper and recycled materials with computing and discuss a suite
  of computational design tools her research team has developed. She will d
 escribe how combinations of everyday materials with computation can expand
  creative possibilities while leveraging familiarity to empower designers 
 and learners.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\nHyunJoo Oh is an assistant professor with
  a joint appointment in the School of Industrial Design and the School of 
 Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech. Working at the intersection of Huma
 n-Computer Interaction and Design\, she develops computational design tool
 s that integrate everyday materials with computing. Her work investigates 
 fundamental questions on how people see and think\, and make\, in particul
 ar how those are closely linked and shape each other. Her work has been pu
 blished and exhibited at ACM SIGCHI conferences such as CHI\, TEI\, and DI
 S\, and featured in venues including CNET and Maker Ed.\n\nSchedule of Bro

 \, Public\, Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\, Freebies\nStatus: 
 published\n\nA Frontiers in Science Lecture to celebrate 2019\, the Intern
 ational Year of the Periodic Table\nIn 1997\, the Japanese oceanographer Y
 oshiyuki Nozaki compiled a periodic table of ocean chemistry\, encapsulati
 ng the distribution of elements as a function of depth. In this periodic t
 able\, many elements share similar patterns\, classified into just a few c
 ategories. The similarities indicate a common set of mechanisms behind the
  ocean cycling of elements.\n\nThe interaction of ocean circulation\, chem
 istry\, and biology sets the distribution of elements in the ocean. For ex
 ample\, nonreactive elements are nearly uniformly distributed in the water
  column\, homogenized by ocean circulation and mixing.\n\nNutrient element
 s are depleted near the surface because of biological consumption and enri
 ched in mid-depth due to decomposition of organic matter. Some trace metal
 s – such as Fe\, Zn\, Ni\, and Cd – follow this pattern. In contrast\,
  some heavy metals – like Al\, Mn\, Co\, and Pb – are subsumed into pa
 rticles and removed from seawater.\n\nBuilding on the insights from Nozaki
 ’s periodic table\, this talk will interpret recent measurements of chan
 ging seawater chemistry\, highlighting the importance of rising carbon dio
 xide concentration in the air\, climate change\, and pollution of rivers a
 nd atmosphere.\n\nAbout the Speaker\nTakamitsu “Taka” Ito [1] is an as
 sociate professor in the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences\, where 
 he teaches physical and chemical oceanography. He received a Ph.D. in Eart
 h\, Atmospheric\, and Planetary Sciences in 2005 from Massachusetts Instit
 ute of Technology. His research has focused on the cycling of carbon\, oxy
 gen\, and iron in the global oceans\, using observations\, theory\, and co
 mputational modeling.\n\nAbout Frontiers in Science Lectures\nLectures in 
 this series are intended to inform\, engage\, and inspire students\, facul
 ty\, staff\, and the public on developments\, breakthroughs\, and topics o
 f general interest in the sciences and mathematics. Lecturers tailor their
  talks for nonexpert audiences.\n\nAbout the Periodic Table Frontiers in S

 derated by Charlie Bennett [01]\, this panel discussion brings two scienti
 sts and two science fiction writers together to explore how science and ar
 t have long influenced each other while shaping public understanding of th
 e periodic table and chemical elements and their role in our everyday live
 s.\n\nGeorgia Tech scientists Deirdre Shoemaker [02] and M.G. Finn [03] wi
 ll have a conversation with Milton J. Davis [04]\, science fiction writer 
 and chemist\, and Amanda Weiss [05]\, an up-and-coming science fiction aut
 hor who teaches Japanese at Georgia Tech. Through their conversation\, we 
 hope to get a closer look at how new — and sometimes very old! — ideas
  about how the world works circulate through science\, fiction\, and cultu
 re at large.\n\nAbout the Discussants\nCharlie Bennett [01] is the public 
 engagement librarian and economics specialist at Georgia Tech. He holds a 
 Master’s in Library and Information Science from Valdosta State Universi

 ls and editor or co-editor of seven anthologies. He owns MVmedia\, LLC\, a
  small publishing company specializing in science fiction\, fantasy\, and 
 "Sword and Soul." Davies is also the technical director of Hill Manufactur
 ing\, a company specializing in maintenance chemicals and products. As a r
 esearch chemist\, he has developed polymers for the textile\, janitorial\,
  and computer industries. In 2004\, he received a U.S. patent for a cleani

 he James A. Carlos Family Chair for Pediatric Technology. In his research\
 , his laboratory develops new vaccines\, ways to find and kill cancer cell
 s\, new materials for drug delivery and membrane-based separations\, and w
 ays to evolve molecules with desired functions. He is the editor-in-chief 
 of the journal ACS Combinatorial Science. His science fiction inspirations

  Georgia Tech Center for Relativistic Astrophysics and associate director 
 of the Institute for Data Engineering and Sciences. Black holes\, spacetim

 omy and Astrophysics Advisory Council and the NASA LISA Study Team. She is
  also a member of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration\, which detected gravi

 :\n\nAs industrial design continues to embrace digital manufacturing\, we 
 are in constant danger of losing the culturally indicative crafts that exp
 ress individual cultures. As global wealth inequality grows\, can we creat
 e low tech\, parametric tools to bring products to global market? Does the
  spread of generative design in products have to mean a drop in artisanal 
 jobs that support entire towns and regions? Can we blur the line between d
 esigner and maker by working collaboratively? In this talk we look at ways
  that new design tools can go to emerging and potential markets to create 
 opportunity without losing jobs\, skills\, and traditions.\n\nThis topic c
 an connect design to production by looking upstream\, encourages socially 
 sustainable practice. This can allow us to design for production near the 
 material source taking advantage of embodied skills instead of homogenizin
 g design.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\nLisa Marks is an industrial designer whose wo
 rk combines craft and algorithmic design. She uses technological adaptatio
 ns of traditional techniques to promote sustainable methods of production 
 that help endangered craft communities. Her work has been presented at des
 ign weeks in New York\, Milan\, and Bangkok and has recently won the 2019 
 International Grand Prix Lexus Design Award. Lisa holds an MFA from Parson
 s School of Design and Is currently an Assistant Professor of Industrial D
 esign at Georgia Institute of Technology.\n\nSchedule of Brown Bag Speaker

 \nAssistant Professor Sung Jin Park | Coulter Department of Biomedical Eng
 ineering\, Georgia Institute of Technology & Emory University\, School of 
 Medicine\nAbstract: Utilizing living materials as building blocks for engi
 neered biohybrid systems enables replicating biological activities in vitr
 o at a cellular\, tissue and organ level. Furthermore\, integrating stem c
 ell technologies offer new strategies of personalized medicine\, from enab
 ling drug discovery to engineering transplantable artificial organs. In th
 is talk\, I will focus on our tissue-engineering approach to recapitulate 
 biological functions at tissue- and system- levels\, by advancing the cont
 rol of living building blocks. First\, I will discuss optogenetic approach
  for the development of biohybrid soft-robotic swimmers capable of coordin
 ated muscle contraction and undulatory swimming. Second\, I will present t
 he development of tissue-level model of a human inherited cardiac monogeni
 c disease\, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia\, which 
 can recapitulate exercise-induce arrhythmia upon optogenetic and catechola
 mine stimulation. Both biohybrid examples illustrate the potential and pro
 gress of the biohybrid systems to transform human muscle disease models as
  well as artificial tissues and organs.\n\nBio: Sung Jin Park\, PhD\, is a
 n Assistant Professor in the Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering 
 at Georgia Tech and Emory University School of Medicine. He received Bache
 lor's and Master's degrees in Mechanical Engineering from Seoul National U
 niversity in Korea\, and his PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Stanford U
 niversity with double Master's degree in Electrical Engineering. He then c
 ontinued postdoctoral research at the John A. Paulson School of Engineerin
 g and Applied Sciences and Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engine
 ering at Harvard University\, where he developed engineered biological sys
 tems using living materials as building blocks. He has focused on enabling
  the control of biological systems across scales from artificial cells\, t
 o engineered tissues\, to artificial soft-robots\, in order to better reca
 pitulate biological activities and to build more complex living system. Hi
 s work on tissue-engineered soft-robotic rays and photosynthetic organelle
 s was selected as a cover of Science and Nature Biotechnology. The tissue-
 engineered ray was also selected as one of Popular Science best inventions
  of year 2016 and Gold Edison Award of 2017 and featured in more than 100 
 news outlets such as New York Times\, BBC\, Financial Times\, and Economis

 published\n\nA Frontiers in Science Lecture to celebrate 2019\, the Intern
 ational Year of the Periodic Table\nChemical elements have played importan
 t roles in the geopolitics of modern times and will continue to do so.\n\n
 From Einstein’s 1939 letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt [1] highl
 ighting the need to secure uranium ores\, to an insurgency fought over pho
 sphorus\, to a Chinese embargo of rare-earth elements in retaliation for a
  maritime incident in the East China Sea\, to “blood batteries” for el
 ectric vehicles dependent on cobalt mined by child laborers in the Democra
 tic Republic of Congo\, to calls for new international agreements on aster
 oid mining\, the role of elements in geopolitics is vast and significant.\
 n\nWhat does this mean for the U.S.\, for the rest of the world\, and for 
 the future of technology?\n\nAbout the Speaker\nMargaret E. Kosal [2] is a
 n associate professor in Georgia Tech’s Sam Nunn School of International

 roducing and utilizing videos in their courses. Have you ever wondered how
  students are using these resources? Are you concerned that students might
  not be watching the videos or might be skipping through them? Have you ev
 er thought about how you could make your videos more engaging? Watching vi
 deos is a very passive activity--but it doesn’t have to stay that way\, 
 thanks to innovative technologies that allow you to add interactive featur
 es to your videos.\n\nIn this spotlight workshop\, we will explore the tec
 hnology and pedagogy behind Interactive Video Quizzes from Kaltura. We’l
 l examine how you can use Kaltura to create quizzes that exist inside vide
 os and describe how you can best leverage this technology in your own cour
 ses. We’ll also discuss the concept of frequent quizzing and explain how
  such a technique can benefit student learning. And we’ll hear from Dr. 
 Tatiana Rudechenko\, a faculty member in Scheller\, who has successfully i
 mplemented video quizzing in her own course. Tatiana will share her experi
 ence\, lessons learned\, and tips for using this technique with your stude
 nts.\n\nJoin us and learn first-hand about video quizzing and generate ide
 as for innovative uses with your colleagues. Bring your laptop to get a ju
 mp on creating your own video quizzes by engaging in hands-on activities o
 r simply follow along with someone at your table. All are encouraged to at
 tend--from novices who have just started to think about creating videos to
  experts looking to add another tool to their video skill set. We look for

 \nTITLE: Lessons from Designing\, Building\, and Operating a Hyper-scale G
 lobal Wide Area Network\n\nABSTRACT:\n\nCloud computing has ushered in a n
 ew class of hyper-scale systems\, characterized by large-scale distributed
  systems\, global connectivity\, and ubiquitous computing models that span
  the spectrum from centralized data centers to the edge. Powering these hy
 per-scales are global networks that connect end-users through various othe
 r networks and devices to the cloud. In this talk\, we describe our journe
 y in building the network of one of the biggest cloud systems\, Microsoft 
 Azure. This network is built out of 130K+ miles of terrestrial and subsea 
 cables\, processes an average of 30 billion packets/second\, and interconn
 ects with more than 20K peering points around the globe. We describe many 
 of the technological and engineering building blocks that enable us to bui
 ld and reliably operate this network\, including innovations in fiber opti
 cs\, software-defined networking\, network design\, switch software and gl
 obal-scale monitoring\, and simulation software.\n\nBIO:\n\nYousef Khalidi
  is responsible for product and program management for Azure Networking\, 
 which covers Microsoft’s global investments in cloud networking software
  and hardware. He drives strategic business planning\, including world-wid
 e partner coverage and deep integration with Microsoft services. Khalidi w
 as a member of the team that conceived and built the initial version of Mi
 crosoft Azure (code named Red Dog) and has served in several engineering\,
  product management\, and architectural roles in Azure. Prior to joining M
 icrosoft\, Khalidi spent 14 years at Sun Microsystems\, where he was a dis
 tinguished engineer. At Sun\, he held several R&D\, architecture\, and man
 agement positions in enterprise software\, including CTO and chief archite
 ct of Solaris\, chief architect of Sun’s N1 utility computing platform\,
  chief architect and director of the Sun Cluster product line\, and as a p
 rincipal architect of the Solaris MC and the Spring advanced development p
 rojects. Khalidi also served as a member of Sun’s Technical Advisory Cou
 ncil. Khalidi earned his bachelor’s degree in computer science from West
  Virginia University\, where he graduated summa cum laude. He earned his M
 .S. and Ph.D. in information and computer science from Georgia Tech\, with
  a minor in performance evaluation and statistics. Khalidi is a member of 
 the Georgia Tech Advisory Board\, as well as QCRI’s Scientific Advisory 
 Committee. He holds over 50 patents in distributed systems\, networking\,

 ses GPS mostly to track and monitor vehicles\, but there is much more info
 rmation embedded with GPS readings. However\, it is not always simple to e
