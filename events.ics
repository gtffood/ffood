 s for spatial data creation\, capture and analysis and has drawn talented 
 individuals to this research.\n\nYet\, these programs and research agendas
  often operate without an explicit ‘plan’ for how technology and data 
 analysis will tackle real world issues. Because these fields are founded w
 ith technocratic and engineering problem-solving ideals (values inherent t
 o analytics and ‘smart’ endeavors)\, research questions and execution 
 in this field may be need re-definition and intervention if they are to he
 lp cities reach the most vulnerable citizens and improve daily life. Resea
 rch and thought leadership in UA and SC should include the voices and inpu
 t of the typical urbanite and those most in need. This field also should d
 eeply consider how different perspectives on race\, ethnicity\, gender\, s
 exual-orientation\, disability and poverty status (and more) may add cruci
 al variables to the study of urban analytics.\n\nResearch Contribution\nWe
  will be generating solutions for how our research and teaching can includ
 e a more diverse body of tacit knowledge from the urban community and how 
 can we solve real-life problems with data analytics. We will be developing
  strategies and recommending formal research frameworks (mixed-method\, mu
 lti-scale\, validating-by-interview\, etc.) to guide UA and SC research to
 wards championing citizen voices and helping people. Our goal is to empowe
 r UA students and researchers to shape urban research questions\, methodol
 ogies and implementation in way that positively impacts the city and its p
 eople.\n\nWe will have meaningful conversations and develop a guiding agen
 da that can serve as an ‘intervention’ that is needed as UA and SC fie
 lds mature. Without this discussion\, these fields may not adopt the kinds
  of sensitivities towards diversity\, inclusion and the human experience\,
  that it needs to best serve the people. The agenda will help put forth:\n
 \n- A plan to put crucial information into the hands of the city’s most 
 vulnerable populations.\n- Methods for using technology to collect data on
  spatial behaviors in a safe\, privacy-securing way\, and using the inform
 ation to optimize locations of services and facilities.\n- Designs for tec
 h education for disadvantaged and underrepresented populations at multiple
  levels.\n- Methods to identify which small changes can have the biggest i
 mpact.\n- How to listen to and learn from citizens who need help and have 
 first-hand perspectives (i.e. tacit knowledge) on the urban ecosystem.\n- 
 Open ended discussion on how to connect urban analytics to common-sense ur
 ban problems.\n\nActivities\nOur panel sessions will contain five speakers
  each\, and will include a mixture of visuals and oral presentations.\n\nB
 reakout sessions will divide our participants into 3 groups. The topics wi
 ll be formed by our set of distinguished breakout leaders and can be adjus

 ound\nUrban Analytics (UA) and Smart Cities (SC) degree programs are becom
 ing more common in the U.S. and globally. Often\, these programs don’t h
 ave a ‘plan’ for how technology and data analysis will tackle real wor
 ld issues\, or an understanding of how different perspectives on race\, et
 hnicity\, gender\, sexual-orientation\, disability and poverty status (and
  more) may add crucial variables to the study of urban analytics.\n\nAltho
 ugh the UA field is data-rich\, the questions and studies in this field ma
 y be ill-suited for helping cities reach the most vulnerable citizens\, or
  how to best empower UA students to positively impact to the city and its 
 people. Because these fields were founded with technocratic and engineerin
 g problem-solving ideals (values inherent to analytics and ‘smart’ end
 eavors)\, the research and thought leadership in UA ad SC lacks the voices
  and input of the typical urbanite and those most in need\, although it co
 ntributes powerful methods and draws talent.\n\nResearch Contribution\nWe 
 will be generating solutions for how our research and teaching can include
  a more diverse body of tacit knowledge from the urban community and how c
 an we solve real-life problems with data analytics? We will be developing 
 strategies and recommending formal research frameworks (mixed-method\, mul
 ti-scale\, validating-by-interview\, etc.) to guide UA and SC research tow
 ards championing citizen voices and helping people.\n\nOur task is to have
  meaningful conversations and develop a guiding agenda that can serve as a
 n ‘intervention’ that is needed as UA and SC fields mature. Without th
 is discussion\, these fields may not adopt the kinds of sensitivities towa

 retention\, and advancement of faculty who would more fully represent our 
 diverse world—in particular women and people of color. In this book\, Ab
 igail Stewart and Virginia Valian argue that diversity and excellence go h
 and in hand and provide guidance for achieving both.\n\nStewart and Valian
 \, themselves senior academics\, support their argument with comprehensive
  data from a range of disciplines. They show why merit is often overlooked
 \; they offer statistics and examples of individual experiences of exclusi
 on\, such as being left out of crucial meetings\; and they outline institu
 tional practices that keep exclusion invisible\, including reliance on pro
 xies for excellence\, such as prestige\, that disadvantage outstanding can
 didates who are not members of the white male majority.\n\nPerhaps most im
 portant\, Stewart and Valian provide practical advice for overcoming obsta
 cles to inclusion. This advice is based on their experiences at their own 
 universities\, their consultations with faculty and administrators at many
  other institutions\, and data on institutional change. Stewart and Valian
  offer recommendations for changing structures and practices so that peopl
 e become successful in ways that benefit everyone. They describe better wa
 ys of searching for job candidates\; evaluating candidates for hiring\, te
 nure\, and promotion\; helping faculty succeed\; and broadening rewards an
 d recognition.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.edu/node/633364#0

 \, Public\, Undergraduate students\nStatus: published\n\nOverheating light
 ing instruments coupled with human error are a leading cause of intraopera
 tive fires and patient burns. The healthcare system refers to these as “
 never events” so they should never happen\, right? But\, data suggests t
 hat they occur more than twice a day. This was a red flag for Jackson Medi
 cal Co-founders James Rains and Kamil Makhnejia.\n\nAt the Georgia Institu
 te of Technology\, Rains and Makhnejia began conceptualizing GloShield™ 
 to address this safety issue. They then brought on to the team Dr. Spencer
  Kozin\, a local Atlanta urologist\, who not only resonated with the safet
 y issue being addressed\, but also provided clinical expertise to the team
 .\n\nTogether\, the future Jackson Medical team knew they had a great base
  concept but to successfully commercialize the idea\, they would need an a
 dditional outside design and development perspective. “We knew that we h
 ad an innovative concept and that there is nothing like GloShield currentl
 y on the market\, but needed to ensure that we were taking the correct ste
 ps that would help us reach commercialization in a timely and cost-efficie
 nt manner\,” Rains said.\n\nProfessor Rains\, Dr. Kozin\, Mr. Makhnejia 
 will discuss the questions researchers and innovators must answer and what
  they should anticipate from a funding and development timeline standpoint
  at the earliest stages of the pathway in their medical product concept’
 s journey toward commercialization.\n\nLunch will be provided free of char

 ve been very successful in performing tasks where the inputs are well defi
 ned and known in advance. Automotive and electronic manufacturing are the 
 classic success stories where robotic systems have demonstrated incredible
  value for the industry. In unstructured manufacturing\, the inputs of the
  system can vary significantly\, but the outputs of the system are defined
 . Food and agriculture production are examples of this type of unstructure
 d manufacturing problem\, but traditional manufacturing is also moving in 
 this direction as robotics move beyond welding and painting. This presenta
 tion will give examples of systems that integrate advanced perception and 
 control technologies into robotic systems to perform complex tasks like cu
 tting\, grasping\, and manipulation of objects in an unstructured environm

 \nComposite Materials: The growing pains of a "young technology" destined 
 for a very bright future\n\nComposites are a young and unique class of mat
 erials that provide engineering freedom and integration of parts and funct
 ions. In the last 30 years\, composites have evolved from niche to mainstr
 eam thanks to major advances in chemistry\, material science and automatio
 n. However\, the industry is still not extracting the full potential of th
 e technology to maximize performance\, increase production rates and reduc
 e total cost of ownership. The future widespread adoption of composites ac
 ross multiple markets will be driven by innovations in high throughput man
 ufacturing\, multi-functionality\, environmental sustainability\, simulati
 on and modelling.\n\nDate: Friday\, April 17th\nTime: 11AM – 12:15 PM (l
 unch following in the GTMI atrium)\nLocation:\nGTMI Auditorium #101\nGeorg

 rof. Marilyn Smith]\n\nwill defend a doctoral thesis entitled\,\n\nA Refin
 ed Potential Theory for the Incompressible Unsteady Subcritical-Reynolds n
 umber Flows on Canonical Bluff Bodies\n\nOn\n\nTuesday\, May 5 at 2:00 p.m
 .\nBluejeans: [1]\n\nAbstract\n\nClassical potential theory falls short of
  reconciling the actions of fluid viscosity and frictional forces in an ac
 tual flow with the theoretical analysis of such a flow. As such\, it is un
 able to predict the important phenomenon of flow separation that leads\, i
 n part\, to the pressure drag experienced by the body in an actual flow. H
 owever\, analytical solutions that theories provide offer huge advantages 
 over numerical and experimental solutions in the understanding of fluid fl
 ows and in design. These are in terms of cost and time consumption.\n\nThe
 refore\, a refinement of Classical potential theory of the flow over a cir
 cular cylinder was carried out to bridge this gap. It was achieved by intr
 oducing a viscous sink-source-vortex sheet on the surface of the cylinder.
  These singularities are modeled as concentric at every location. The vort
 ices are modeled as Burgers vortices\, and analytic expressions for their 
 strengths and those of the sinks/sources are obtained from the classical t
 heory. These are employed to obtain a Reynolds-number-and-time-dependent s
 tream function that captures important qualitative features of the flow. A
  viscous potential function that satisfies the governing equations is then
  derived. It is obtained by defining the viscous stream function on a prin
 cipal axis of the flow about which the vorticity vector is identically zer
 o. Strategies have also been developed to account for the finite extent of
  the cylinder\, to introduce dynamic unsteadiness\, to predict separation/
 reattachment/transition\, to obtain forces\, and to apply the solution to 
 an arbitrary geometry with a focus on spheres and spheroids.\n\nThe refine
 d potential theory was verified against experimental and numerical data on
  the cylinder in an incompressible crossflow at. Its drag prediction is wi
 thin the error bound of measured data. The prediction of other quantities 
 is also within acceptable ranges. Its prediction of the force coefficients
  over the range was validated against experimental data on the cylinder in
  crossflow. There is a good agreement in the trend with slight disparity i
 n magnitude that is in favor of safety for design purposes. The energy spe
 ctra of the wake velocity display the Kolmogorov's Five-Thirds law of homo
 geneous isotropic turbulence. This verifies and validates the unsteadiness
  in refined potential theory as turbulent in nature.\n\nCommittee\n\n- Pro

 ents\nStatus: published\n\nOverview\nDr. Benoit Montreuil [01] will emphas
 ize the impactful interplay between supply chains and pandemics\, across t
 he world and in each locality. The impact of collectively improving pandem
 ic supply chain readiness and response in each of the five world states - 
 healthy\, outbreak\, epidemics\, pandemics\, and recovery - will be highli
 ghted.\n\nThe focus will be on critical and essential supply chains to dem
 onstrate the capital importance of supply chains in fighting and surviving
  a pandemics\, as revealed by the COVID-19 crisis.\n\n- Critical supply ch
 ains support the fight against the pandemic disease by supporting the boom
 ing demand for testing kits\, masks\, respirators\, etc.\, to hospitals an
 d health centers.\n- Essential supply chains provide the food\, health pro
 ducts and goods necessary to ensure survival\, quality of life and recover
 y capability of pandemic-affected populations and economies\, notably subj
 ect to distancing and containment measures.\n\nKey avenues for collectivel
 y and comprehensively enabling effective and efficient pandemic supply cha
 in readiness and response in each of the world states will be presented. T
 hese avenues combine common-sense pragmatic practices to leading-edge conc
 epts and technologies\, notably based on Artificial Intelligence and the P
 hysical Internet. They notably enable:\n\n- Critical and essential supply 
 chain visibility and predictability\;\n- Smart fair decisions relative to 
 critical and essential product allocation\, deployment\, and transportatio
 n\;\n- Keeping a healthy and efficient supply chain workforce\;\n- Repurpo
 sing supply chains and facilities to provide boost in critical and essenti
 al product availability\;\n- Vector-free logistics eliminating disease pro
 pagation through goods and food production\, packaging\, distribution and 
 delivery.\n\nThe presentation results from the interdisciplinary collabora

 transitioned to an online format for 2020.\n\nClasses will be taught by LI
 VE video instruction similar to the experience you would receive in person
  with the same interactive components.\n\nCourse Description\nMeeting dema
 nd in a timely and cost-effective manner is important both in public and p
 rivate supply chains\, and heavily depend on the design and operation of t
 hese supply chains. Demand is affected by ongoing factors such as local ec
 onomy\, infrastructure\, and geographic location\, as well as unexpected e
 vents such as natural or manmade disasters or other large-scale disruption
 s. Designing and operating responsive supply chains requires the considera
 tion of uncertainty in timing\, scope\, scale\, and understanding of vario
 us topics such as forecasting\, distribution network design\, and inventor
 y management. This course will examine methods and models for making suppl
 y chain design and operational decisions and explore the significant value
  that is obtained through informed decision-making in advance of an unpred
 ictable event or long-term strategy for meeting the need of customers and 
 beneficiaries.\n\nWho Should Attend\nThis course is designed for represent
 atives from governmental or non-governmental organizations\, private corpo
 rations\, military\, and foundations\, including but not limited to senior
  executives overseeing administrative and operational functions of an orga
 nization\, logistics and supply chain managers\, program managers\, direct
 ors of field operations\, directors of emergency/disaster preparedness and
  response\, and public health professionals.\n\nHow You Will Benefit\n- Pr
 ovide immediate impact to your organization through learnings gained from 
 applied and real-world case studies.\n- Learn to bring NGOs\, businesses\,
  or government entities together to enhance collaboration\, cooperation\, 
 and communication.\n- Discover current trends and procedures to help organ
 izations and team members get and stay ahead of the curve.\n- Build a crit
 ical knowledge base to make tactical decisions around inventory\, routing\
 , and distribution.\n- Deliver best practices to measure and evaluate the 
 efficiency\, impact\, and outcomes of focused initiatives or ongoing logis
 tics and supply chain operations.\n- Transform the health and humanitarian
  sectors with increased capacity to participate in planning and strategic 
 decision-making for effective supply-chain management.\n\nWhat Is Covered\

 nWhat Is Juneteenth?\nThis story by Elixabeth Nix was originally published
  on History.com. [5] The story has been adapted for the College of Science
 s.\n\nJuneteenth (short for "June Nineteenth") marks the day when federal 
 troops arrived in Galveston\, Texas in 1865 to take control of the state a
 nd ensure that all enslaved people be freed. The troops' arrival came a fu
 ll two and a half years after signing the Emancipation Proclamation. Junet
 eenth honors the end to slavery in the United States and is considered the
  longest-running African American holiday.\n\nConfederate General Robert E
 . Lee had surrendered at Appomattox Court House two months earlier in Virg
 inia\, but slavery had remained relatively unaffected in Texas - until U.S
 . General Gordon Granger stood on Texas soil and read General Orders No. 3
 : "The people of Texas are informed that\, in accordance with a proclamati
 on from the Executive of the United States\, all slaves are free."\n\nRead

 rse has been transitioned to an online format for 2020.\n\nClasses will be
  taught by LIVE video instruction similar to the experience you would rece
 ive in person with the same interactive components.\n\nCourse Description\
 nOften the lack of cooperation and coordination between organizations or s
 takeholders lead to inefficiencies\, despite having common goals. A system
 s view is needed to ensure appropriate use of scarce resources to meet the
  multiple\, and often conflicting\, short- and long-term goals from multip
 le constituents. This course will focus on conceptual and modeling skills 
 to understand and effectively manage supply chains and operations from a s
 ystems perspective. Models will address system characteristics (e.g.\, dem
 and dependencies) that drive system dynamics and policies to regulate perf
 ormance. Course topics include methods for improving coordination and coll
 aboration\, addressing demand dependencies\, and reliably measuring and ev
 aluating system performance.\n\nWho Should Attend\nThis course is designed
  for representatives from governmental or non-governmental organizations\,
  private corporations\, military\, and foundations\, including but not lim
 ited to senior executives overseeing administrative and operational functi
 ons of an organization\, logistics and supply chain managers\, program man
 agers\, directors of field operations\, directors of emergency/disaster pr
 eparedness and response\, and public health professionals.\n\nHow You Will
  Benefit\n- Identify opportunities for coordination within organizations a
 nd collaboration across organizations for increased efficiency and improve

SUMMARY:Assistant Professor Levi Wood: Systems Analysis of Neural Immune S
 ignaling in Neurodegenerative Diseases
DTSTART;TZID=UTC;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20200730T200000Z
DTEND;TZID=UTC;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20200730T210000Z

DESCRIPTION:Status: unknown\n\nDysregulated neural immune activity contrib
 utes to the pathogenesis of diverse diseases\, including Alzheimer’s dis
 ease\, traumatic brain injury\, and lysosomal storage disorders\, among ot
 hers. Understanding neural immune function and identification of strategie
 s to restore healthy or homeostatic immune activity holds the potential to
  transform our ability to treat neurodegenerative diseases. Neural immune 
 activity is a complex system\, consisting of intracellular regulation of d
 iverse immune genes by phospho-signaling cascades that ultimately control 
 glial phenotypes and expression of extra-cellular signaling factors\, such
  as cytokines\, that communicate between cells and exacerbate dysfunction.
  This talk will consist of two parts.\n\nIn the first part\, I will discus
 s our work\, in collaboration with Dr. Amit Reddi\, to illuminate the role
  of the blood factors heme and hemoglobin in potentiating Alzheimer’s di
 sease pathogenesis. We have found that elevation of these factors in Alzhe
 imer’s disease suppresses immune function of the brain’s immune cells\
 , astrocytes and microglia\, including their abilities to clear amyloid be
 ta\, which is the hallmark protein that forms plaques in Alzheimer’s bra
 ins. By integrating extracellular (cytokine) and intracellular (phospho-pr
 otein) signaling data\, we have determined that heme and hemoglobin attenu
 ate normal immune function by stimulating the PI3K/Akt pathway. Moreover\,
  attenuation of the heme biosynthetic pathway reduced amyloid beta patholo
 gy in 5xFAD Alzheimer’s disease mice. Together\, these data illuminate a
 n entirely new aspect of Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis and suggest a 
 novel mechanism resulting in brain immune cell “fatigue\,” which may b
 e treated by attenuating heme synthesis.\n\nIn the second part\, I will di
 scuss our work to identify neuroinflammatory signaling responsible for cog
 nitive deficit after repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). We use
  a weight drop closed head injury mouse model relevant to sports injury in
  which a subset of mice experience cognitive deficit despite having no ove
 rt signs of neuronal injury. Using a non-invasive optical cerebral blood f
 low sensor\, we found that mice with acutely low cerebral blood flow after
  mTBI would suffer long term memory deficit and had elevated acute microgl
 ial activation. Surprisingly\, microglial activation was accompanied by ne
 uronal pro-inflammatory phospho-signaling and cytokine expression\, sugges
 ting for the first time that neural immunity and cognitive deficit depends
  on the interplay between glia and neurons. Moreover\, our ongoing studies
  suggest that inhibition of phospho-signaling using translationally releva
 nt small molecules has the potential to restore cognitive function after r
 epetitive mTBI.\n\nDr. Wood has been an assistant professor in the Institu
 te for Bioengineering and Bioscience at Georgia Tech since August 2015. He
  completed his PhD at MIT where he developed novel microfluidics to identi
 fy mechanisms governing blood vessel geometry during angiogenesis. For his
  postdoc\, Levi\, joined the signaling systems biology laboratories of Kev
 in Haigis and Douglas Lauffenburger at MGH and MIT. While there\, he used 
 engineering systems methods to identify new mechanisms of cell death in Al
 zheimer’s disease and the inflamed intestine. The Wood lab combines engi
 neering systems analysis with multi-dimensional datasets from human tissue
 s\, mouse models\, and 2D and 3D cell culture models to understand the rol
 es of neural immune activity in promoting healthy brain function and in dr
 iving diverse neurological disorders. In addition to identifying underlyin
 g mechanisms of disease\, Dr. Wood has a particular interest in identifyin
 g rapidly translatable treatment approaches using re-purposed drugs for ca
 ncer and other conditions that may already be commercially available or la
 te stage development. Dr. Wood’s areas of study include traumatic brain

SUMMARY:Asst. Professor Levi Wood: Systems Analysis of Neural Immune Signa
 ling in Neurodegenerative Diseases
DTSTART;TZID=UTC;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20200730T200000Z

DESCRIPTION:Status: unknown\n\nDysregulated neural immune activity contrib
 utes to the pathogenesis of diverse diseases\, including Alzheimer’s dis
 ease\, traumatic brain injury\, and lysosomal storage disorders\, among ot
 hers. Understanding neural immune function and identification of strategie
 s to restore healthy or homeostatic immune activity holds the potential to
  transform our ability to treat neurodegenerative diseases. Neural immune 
 activity is a complex system\, consisting of intracellular regulation of d
 iverse immune genes by phospho-signaling cascades that ultimately control 
 glial phenotypes and expression of extra-cellular signaling factors\, such
  as cytokines\, that communicate between cells and exacerbate dysfunction.
  This talk will consist of two parts.\n\nIn the first part\, I will discus
 s our work\, in collaboration with Dr. Amit Reddi\, to illuminate the role
  of the blood factors heme and hemoglobin in potentiating Alzheimer’s di
 sease pathogenesis. We have found that elevation of these factors in Alzhe
 imer’s disease suppresses immune function of the brain’s immune cells\
 , astrocytes and microglia\, including their abilities to clear amyloid be
 ta\, which is the hallmark protein that forms plaques in Alzheimer’s bra
 ins. By integrating extracellular (cytokine) and intracellular (phospho-pr
 otein) signaling data\, we have determined that heme and hemoglobin attenu
 ate normal immune function by stimulating the PI3K/Akt pathway. Moreover\,
  attenuation of the heme biosynthetic pathway reduced amyloid beta patholo
 gy in 5xFAD Alzheimer’s disease mice. Together\, these data illuminate a
 n entirely new aspect of Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis and suggest a 
 novel mechanism resulting in brain immune cell “fatigue\,” which may b
 e treated by attenuating heme synthesis.\n\nIn the second part\, I will di
 scuss our work to identify neuroinflammatory signaling responsible for cog
 nitive deficit after repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). We use
  a weight drop closed head injury mouse model relevant to sports injury in
  which a subset of mice experience cognitive deficit despite having no ove
 rt signs of neuronal injury. Using a non-invasive optical cerebral blood f
 low sensor\, we found that mice with acutely low cerebral blood flow after
  mTBI would suffer long term memory deficit and had elevated acute microgl
 ial activation. Surprisingly\, microglial activation was accompanied by ne
 uronal pro-inflammatory phospho-signaling and cytokine expression\, sugges
 ting for the first time that neural immunity and cognitive deficit depends
  on the interplay between glia and neurons. Moreover\, our ongoing studies
  suggest that inhibition of phospho-signaling using translationally releva
 nt small molecules has the potential to restore cognitive function after r
 epetitive mTBI.\n\nDr. Wood has been an assistant professor in the Institu
 te for Bioengineering and Bioscience at Georgia Tech since August 2015. He
  completed his PhD at MIT where he developed novel microfluidics to identi
 fy mechanisms governing blood vessel geometry during angiogenesis. For his
  postdoc\, Levi\, joined the signaling systems biology laboratories of Kev
 in Haigis and Douglas Lauffenburger at MGH and MIT. While there\, he used 
 engineering systems methods to identify new mechanisms of cell death in Al
 zheimer’s disease and the inflamed intestine. The Wood lab combines engi
 neering systems analysis with multi-dimensional datasets from human tissue
 s\, mouse models\, and 2D and 3D cell culture models to understand the rol
 es of neural immune activity in promoting healthy brain function and in dr
 iving diverse neurological disorders. In addition to identifying underlyin
 g mechanisms of disease\, Dr. Wood has a particular interest in identifyin
 g rapidly translatable treatment approaches using re-purposed drugs for ca
 ncer and other conditions that may already be commercially available or la
 te stage development. Dr. Wood’s areas of study include traumatic brain 
 injury\, Alzheimer’s disease\, and the lysosomal storage disorder\, muco
 lipidosis IV.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  https://www.chemistry.gatech.edu/event/asst-

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Postdoc
 \, Undergraduate students\nStatus: published\n\nLet's get together for som
 e self-care Tapping\, breathing and centering\, to better manage stress\, 
 and access more calm and clarity.\n\nWhen: Tuesdays & Thursdays in July\, 
 Noon ~ 12:30\, (August ~ TBD)\nWhere: Drop In Zoom (Initial download/setup
  might be required) [01]\nWhat: 1. Casual chat on stress & Tapping intro (
 as needed)\n2. "Tapping" similar to this video " Trauma Tapping Technique 
 [02]."\n\nThe self-help technique to be shared may provide you with some w
 ays to calm down stress and other emotions. However\, it is not a treatmen
 t or prescription for any medial or mental health issues\, nor a substitut
 e for regular medical or psychological care. If you have a medical or psyc
 hological condition\, please consult your doctor or other appropriate lice
 nsed health practitioner. Joining the Tapping session does not constitute 
 a professional relationship between the viewers and the presenters. Choosi
 ng to Tap along means you are taking responsibility for your own self. We 
 hope the session will contain some helpful information to you.\n\n- Mental

 .\, MDiv [06]\n- Video: " How to Make Stress Your Friend [07] " by Psychol
 ogist Kelly McGonigal\n".... the harmful effects of stress on your health 
 are not inevitable. How you think and how you act can transform your exper
 ience of stress. When you choose to view your stress response as helpful\,
  you create the biology of courage. And when you choose to connect with ot
 hers under stress\, you can create resilience....Stress gives us access to
  our hearts. The compassionate heart that finds joy and meaning in connect
 ing with others\, and yes\, your pounding physical heart\, working so hard
  to give you strength and energy. And when you choose to view stress in th
 is way\, you're not just getting better at stress\, you're actually making
  a pretty profound statement. You're saying that you can trust yourself to
  handle life's challenges. And you're remembering that you don't have to f
 ace them alone. "\n- Video: " First Aid for Emotional Distress - Trauma Ta

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Postdoc
 \, Undergraduate students\nStatus: draft\n\nThe build up of stress has con
 sequences for the mind and body. Poor sleep\, lack of appetite\, decreased
  productivity\, decreased immunity\, susceptibility to sickness\, are some
  of the few\, and we might find it difficult to get out of the vicious cyc
 le of stress. Except\, nowadays there are some very simple and effective w
 ays to nip the stress bud so we can prevent the over-growth! Come\, join\,
  and learn and try "Tapping" - a simple stress management method to add to
  your tool box. A brief introduction (and actually doing it) is all you ne
 ed so we can better Tap into calm. When: Noon ~ 12:30\, most Fridays start
 ing August 28.\nWhere: Drop In Zoom (Initial download/setup likely require

 nJoin the BlueJeans Meeting [1]\n\nABSTRACT\nAntarctic krill (Euphausia su
 perba) is a key component of the Antarctic food web with considerable lipi
 d reserves that are vital for both their own and higher predator survival.
  Krill feed on diatoms\, dinoflagellates and other algal species year-roun
 d\, resulting in high omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids which are essent
 ial for krill health\, growth and reproduction. Krill-derived omega-3 cont
 aining products (particularly eicosapentacnoic acid (20:5w3) and docosahex
 aenoic acid (22:6w3)) are sold as nutraceuticals for human consumption. Kr
 ill oil tablets (sold as an omega-3 supplement) are now one of the fastest
  growing nutraceuticals globally. However\, few attempts have been made to
  link the spatial and temporal variations in krill lipids to those in thei
 r food supply. Knowledge of krill diet and krill lipid dynamics is lacking
  for the Indian and Pacific Oceans\, as most studies have focused on the S
 outh Atlantic Ocean sector where the krill fishery is based. Most research
  voyages are conducted during the summer and all scientific studies are re
 stricted in their spatial and temporal scales. Another major gap in curren
 t Antarctic ecosystem models is the link between environmental drivers and
  their impact on primary production and therefore food availability. Satel
 lite-derived data for biological and ecological measures is still developi
 ng as a tool although outputs such as ocean colour data which can be conve
 rted into chlorophyll a concentrations (a proxy for primary production)\, 
 are becoming more common. This seminar will cover recent developments in t
 he knowledge of spatiotemporal fluctuations of krill lipid biochemistry in
  relation to their environment.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.edu/node/

 \, Undergraduate students\nStatus: draft\n\nThe build up of stress has con
 sequences for the mind and body. Poor sleep\, lack of appetite\, decreased
  productivity\, decreased immunity\, susceptibility to sickness\, are some
  of the few\, and we might find it difficult to get out of the vicious cyc
 le of stress. Except\, nowadays there are some very simple and effective w
 ays to nip the stress bud so we can prevent the over-growth! Come\, join\,
  and learn and try "Tapping" - a simple stress management method to add to
  your tool box. A brief introduction (and actually doing it) is all you ne
 ed so we can better Tap into calm. When: Noon ~ 12:30\, most Fridays start
 ing August 28.\nWhere: Drop In Zoom (Initial download/setup likely require
 d for phone/computer) [01]\nWhat: 1. "Tapping" similar to this video " Tra
 uma Tapping Technique [02]."\n2. Chat and Q&A (Please feel free to leave e

 are not inevitable. How you think and how you act can transform your exper
 ience of stress. When you choose to view your stress response as helpful\,
  you create the biology of courage. And when you choose to connect with ot
 hers under stress\, you can create resilience....Stress gives us access to
  our hearts. The compassionate heart that finds joy and meaning in connect
 ing with others\, and yes\, your pounding physical heart\, working so hard
  to give you strength and energy. And when you choose to view stress in th
 is way\, you're not just getting better at stress\, you're actually making
  a pretty profound statement. You're saying that you can trust yourself to
  handle life's challenges. And you're remembering that you don't have to f
 ace them alone. "\n- Video: " First Aid for Emotional Distress - Trauma Ta

 rof. Dimitri Mavris]\n\nwill defend a doctoral thesis entitled\,\n\nA Fram
 ework for Fan Stage Conceptual Design Under Distortion\n\nInduced by Bound
 ary Layer Ingestion\n\nWednesday\, October 14 at 12:00 p.m.\nMeeting Link:
  [1]\n\nAbstract\nVarious tightly integrated aircraft concepts have emerge
 d as a result of aggressive performance goals set forth by various organiz
 ations. Most integrated aircraft system configurations exploit the concept
  of Boundary Layer Ingestion (BLI). While the potential benefits of BLI ar
 e huge\, several significant challenges - both on the modeling and design 
 fronts - appear due to BLI. This dissertation focuses on addressing the im
 pacts of BLI induced circumferential flow distortion on the conceptual des
 ign of a fan stage.\n\nDistortion introduces extra losses in both rotors a
 nd stators in addition to increased unsteady rotor response. In presence o
 f incidence swings\, conventional conceptual design tools are inadequate t
 o design optimal rotor blades and generate non-axisymmetric stators\, a co
 ncept that has shown promise in alleviating stage losses due to distortion
 . Besides\, concerns of structural integrity also arise for rotor blades d
 ue to the unsteady loading they experience when rotating in a distorted fl
 ow field. Parametric effects of these phenomena with varying levels of dis
 tortion are quantified\, and a significant portion of the fan stage losses
  are shown to be recoverable using the aero-structural design framework in
 troduced and developed in this dissertation.\n\nThe aerodynamic design fra
 mework is developed through several extensions to the conventionally used 
 multi-meanline method. The inclusion of additional features accounts for f
 low asymmetry\, parametric blade angle optimization\, rotor unsteady perfo
 rmance\, and non-axisymmetric stator design. The model is verified\, and e
 xperiments are performed to evaluate the effectiveness of each modeling el
 ement. Similarly\, the Variational Asymptotic Method (VAM) is proposed as 
 a computationally efficient technique to perform transient structural anal
 ysis of rotor blades. VAM is validated for a variety of loading scenarios 
 and is leveraged to demonstrate the nature of vibratory stresses and highl
 ight the concerns of resonance on a test case. The framework encapsulating
  both aerodynamic design and structural analysis is finally utilized to ex
 plore the design space to minimize vibratory stresses on the blades with a
  small trade-off in the stage efficiency. The fan stage design resulting f
 rom the framework proposed and formulated in this dissertation aims to ser
 ve as a starting point for the preliminary design of a distortion-tolerant
  fan.\n\nCommittee\n\n- Prof. Dimitri Mavris – School of Aerospace Engin

 ll and DramaTech would like to invite you to celebrate with us at our firs
 t ever Fall Festival!\nDramaTech's Fall Festival is a fully virtual event 
 hosted by DT's Outreach Committee. It will be held over two nights (Octobe
 r 16th and 17th) with a few different opportunities to come out for some F
 all fun.\n\nOn Night One (October 16th @ 8pm)\, join us for a *gourd* time
  as we put on a virtual variety show. Performers from the GT community hav
 e submitted their acts and are excited for you to tune in and see their wi
 de array of talents!\n\nOn Night Two (October 17th @ 6pm)\, join us for di
 nner and a show! You can breathe a sigh of re*leaf* if you’re wondering 
 what to do for dinner that night\, as one of DT’s own will be hosting a 
 Cook-A-Long at 6pm! You can learn how to cook a delicious meal and ask any
  and all DT related questions you may have along the way! After dinner is 
 prepared and we’re all settled in at 7:30pm\, movie night will commence.
  Join current DT members and many more from the GT community as we watch a
  movie together and relax for the rest of the evening.\n\nWe hope to see y

 \, Undergraduate students\nStatus: draft\n\nThe build up of stress has con
 sequences for the mind and body. Poor sleep\, lack of appetite\, decreased
  productivity\, decreased immunity\, susceptibility to sickness\, are some
  of the few\, and we might find it difficult to get out of the vicious cyc
 le of stress. Except\, nowadays there are some very simple and effective w
 ays to nip the stress bud so we can prevent the over-growth! Come\, join\,
  and learn and try "Tapping" - a simple stress management method to add to
  your tool box. A brief introduction (and actually doing it) is all you ne
 ed so we can better Tap into calm. When: Noon ~ 12:30\, most Fridays start
 ing August 28.\nWhere: Drop In Zoom (Initial download/setup likely require
 d for phone/computer) [01]\nWhat: 1. "Tapping" similar to this video " Tra
 uma Tapping Technique [02]."\n2. Chat and Q&A (Please feel free to leave e
 arly after Tapping\, as needed\, or you are more than welcome to stay a li
 ttle longer and enjoy a Q&A and some more chat.)\n\n- Mental Health Resour

 are not inevitable. How you think and how you act can transform your exper
 ience of stress. When you choose to view your stress response as helpful\,
  you create the biology of courage. And when you choose to connect with ot
 hers under stress\, you can create resilience....Stress gives us access to
  our hearts. The compassionate heart that finds joy and meaning in connect
 ing with others\, and yes\, your pounding physical heart\, working so hard
  to give you strength and energy. And when you choose to view stress in th
 is way\, you're not just getting better at stress\, you're actually making
  a pretty profound statement. You're saying that you can trust yourself to
  handle life's challenges. And you're remembering that you don't have to f
 ace them alone. "\n- Video: " First Aid for Emotional Distress - Trauma Ta

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Postdoc
 \, Undergraduate students\nStatus: draft\n\nThe build up of stress has con
 sequences for the mind and body. Poor sleep\, lack of appetite\, decreased
  productivity\, decreased immunity\, susceptibility to sickness\, are some
  of the few\, and we might find it difficult to get out of the vicious cyc
 le of stress. Except\, nowadays there are some very simple and effective w
 ays to nip the stress bud so we can prevent the over-growth! Come\, join\,
  and learn and try "Tapping" - a simple stress management method to add to
  your tool box. A brief introduction (and actually doing it) is all you ne
 ed so we can better Tap into calm. When: Noon ~ 12:30\, most Fridays start
 ing August 28.\nWhere: Drop In Zoom (Initial download/setup likely require
 d for phone/computer) [01]\nWhat: 1. "Tapping" similar to this video " Tra
 uma Tapping Technique [02]."\n2. Chat and Q&A (Please feel free to leave e
 arly after Tapping\, as needed\, or you are more than welcome to stay a li
 ttle longer and enjoy a Q&A and some more chat.)\n\n- Mental Health Resour

 ogist Kelly McGonigal\n".... the harmful effects of stress on your health 
 are not inevitable. How you think and how you act can transform your exper
 ience of stress. When you choose to view your stress response as helpful\,
  you create the biology of courage. And when you choose to connect with ot
 hers under stress\, you can create resilience....Stress gives us access to
  our hearts. The compassionate heart that finds joy and meaning in connect
 ing with others\, and yes\, your pounding physical heart\, working so hard
  to give you strength and energy. And when you choose to view stress in th
 is way\, you're not just getting better at stress\, you're actually making
  a pretty profound statement. You're saying that you can trust yourself to
  handle life's challenges. And you're remembering that you don't have to f
 ace them alone. "\n- Video: " First Aid for Emotional Distress - Trauma Ta

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Postdoc
 \, Public\, Undergraduate students\nStatus: published\n\nGordana Vunjak-No
 vakovic\, Ph.D.\nUniversity Professor\nThe Mikati Foundation Professor of 
 Biomedical Engineering and Medicine\nDirector\, Laboratory for Stem Cells 
 and Tissue Engineering\nColumbia University\n\nApproximately 35 million me
 n and women in the United States suffer from TMJ problems\, and as many as
  one in four people experience symptoms of TMJ disorders\, including pain 
 in the chewing muscles\, jaw stiffness\, clicking\, popping or grating\, o
 r the pain of arthritis. The temporomandibular joint\, or TMJ\, is the jaw
  joint that lies in front of each ear\, connecting the mandible (lower jaw
 ) to the skull\, providing the mobility necessary for biting\, chewing\, s
 wallowing food\, speaking\, and making facial expressions.\n\nGordana Vunj
 ak-Novakovic and her research team have been able to grow bone grafts that
  will match a patient’s original jaw bone for facial reconstruction surg
 ery to repair injuries\, disease\, or birth defects. This spectacular adva
 ncement in bone tissue engineering provides all the advantages of the body
 ’s original jaw bone. The team used real bone as a scaffold to grow the 
 new TMJ graft. Taking the knee joints of calves\, they stripped them of al
 l their living cells and carved them into cubic centimeter-size parts of a
  human jaw joint.\n\nUsing mesenchymal stem cells\, which can differentiat
 e into many cell types\, to seed the scaffolding\, they fed them with stre
 ams of nutrients\, growth factors\, and oxygen in a bioreactor. The next s
 tep will be to determine the best way to grow blood vessels in the bone gr
 afts to continue their viability.\n\nIn another research area\, Vunjak-Nov
 akovic is engineering thick\, vascularized\, and electromechanically funct
 ional cardiac tissue\, by culturing stem cells\, the actual “tissue engi
 neers\,” on a channeled elastomer scaffold perfused with culture medium 
 containing oxygen carriers\, to mimic blood flow. This research may lead t
 o a heart patch that could be laid over injured heart tissue to restore no
 rmal function in someone who has suffered a heart attack.\n\n“As a biome
 dical engineer actively involved in this field\, I look forward to unlocki
 ng the full regenerative potential of human stem cells\, so we can cure di
 sease and live longer than our failing organs\,” she said.\n\nHer lab ho
 sts the Bioreactor Core of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Tissue 
 Engineering Resource Center. “This sophisticated bioreactor and imaging 
 instrumentation has moved stem cell research from the ‘flat biology’ o
 f petri dishes to controllable models of high biological fidelity\, which 
 can be studied in real time to observe the interacting factors mediating s
 elf-renewal and differentiation of stem cells\,” said Vunjak-Novakovic. 
 “We now have the capacity to develop entirely new research paradigms and
  approaches to engineering human tissues.”\n\nIn 2002\, Vunjak-Novakovic
  was elected a fellow of the American Institute for Medical and Biological
  Engineering. In 2007\, she gave the Director’s lecture at the NIH\, as 
 the first woman engineer to receive this distinction. She was inducted int
 o the Women in Technology International Hall of Fame in 2008\, elected to 
 the New York Academy of Sciences in 2009\, and\, in 2010\, received the Cl
 emson Award of the Biomaterials Society for contribution to literature.\n\

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Postdoc
 \, Undergraduate students\nStatus: draft\n\nThe build up of stress has con
 sequences for the mind and body. Poor sleep\, lack of appetite\, decreased
  productivity\, decreased immunity\, susceptibility to sickness\, are some
  of the few\, and we might find it difficult to get out of the vicious cyc
 le of stress. Except\, nowadays there are some very simple and effective w
 ays to nip the stress bud so we can prevent the over-growth! Come\, join\,
  and learn and try "Tapping" - a simple stress management method to add to
  your tool box. A brief introduction (and actually doing it) is all you ne
 ed so we can better Tap into calm. When: Noon ~ 12:30\, most Fridays start
 ing August 28.\nWhere: Drop In Zoom (Initial download/setup likely require
 d for phone/computer) [01]\nWhat: 1. "Tapping" similar to this video " Tra

 are not inevitable. How you think and how you act can transform your exper
 ience of stress. When you choose to view your stress response as helpful\,
  you create the biology of courage. And when you choose to connect with ot
 hers under stress\, you can create resilience....Stress gives us access to
  our hearts. The compassionate heart that finds joy and meaning in connect
 ing with others\, and yes\, your pounding physical heart\, working so hard
  to give you strength and energy. And when you choose to view stress in th
 is way\, you're not just getting better at stress\, you're actually making
  a pretty profound statement. You're saying that you can trust yourself to
  handle life's challenges. And you're remembering that you don't have to f
 ace them alone. "\n- Video: " First Aid for Emotional Distress - Trauma Ta

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Postdoc
 \, Undergraduate students\nStatus: draft\n\nThe build up of stress has con
 sequences for the mind and body. Poor sleep\, lack of appetite\, decreased
  productivity\, decreased immunity\, susceptibility to sickness\, are some
  of the few\, and we might find it difficult to get out of the vicious cyc
 le of stress. Except\, nowadays there are some very simple and effective w
 ays to nip the stress bud so we can prevent the over-growth! Come\, join\,
  and learn and try "Tapping" - a simple stress management method to add to
  your tool box. A brief introduction (and actually doing it) is all you ne
 ed so we can better Tap into calm. When: Noon ~ 12:30\, most Fridays start
 ing August 28.\nWhere: Drop In Zoom (Initial download/setup likely require
 d for phone/computer) [01]\nWhat: 1. "Tapping" similar to this video " Tra
 uma Tapping Technique [02]."\n2. Chat and Q&A (Please feel free to leave e
 arly after Tapping\, as needed\, or you are more than welcome to stay a li
 ttle longer and enjoy a Q&A and some more chat.)\n\n- Mental Health Resour

 ogist Kelly McGonigal\n".... the harmful effects of stress on your health 
 are not inevitable. How you think and how you act can transform your exper
 ience of stress. When you choose to view your stress response as helpful\,
  you create the biology of courage. And when you choose to connect with ot
 hers under stress\, you can create resilience....Stress gives us access to
  our hearts. The compassionate heart that finds joy and meaning in connect
 ing with others\, and yes\, your pounding physical heart\, working so hard
  to give you strength and energy. And when you choose to view stress in th
 is way\, you're not just getting better at stress\, you're actually making
  a pretty profound statement. You're saying that you can trust yourself to
  handle life's challenges. And you're remembering that you don't have to f
 ace them alone. "\n- Video: " First Aid for Emotional Distress - Trauma Ta

  Prof. Mavris)\n\nwill defend a doctoral thesis entitled\,\n\nStructural A
 nalysis and Optimization of Aircraft Wings Through Dimensional Reduction\n
 \nOn\n\nTuesday\, December 15\, 2020 at 9:00 a.m.\n[1]\n\nAbstract\nFedera
 l Aviation Regulations (FARs) are critical drivers of aircraft design. Ear
 ly-stage aircraft design involves a tight coupling between structural dyna
 mics\, aerodynamics\, and flight mechanics\, with time-dependent loads ari
 sing from the considerations of the FARs. The current state-of-the-art dec
 ouples the time-domain simulation from the structural failure computation 
 due to high computational costs associated with time-domain structural fai
 lure computation. The need to account for the dynamic loads specified by t
 he FARs while simultaneously achieving low structural weight for fuel effi
 ciency in early-stage aircraft design motivates the following question: Ho
 w to enable computationally efficient structural analysis and optimization
  of early-stage aircraft wing design\, considering dynamics?\n\nExisting m
 ethods simplify the dynamic loads to equivalent static ones and design the
  structure using shell-based analysis. Other literature approaches use com
 putationally efficient beam models for structural sizing but make assumpti
 ons on the geometry and/or material distribution. Higher-order beam theori
 es for structural analysis have been successfully applied to the design of
  slender structures subjected to time-dependent loads\, like rotorcraft bl
 ades. While aircraft wings can be considered slender structures\, aperiodi
 city\, and inhomogeneity along the span render beam theory ineffective.\n\
 nThe present work aims to bridge this gap by proposing a method for analyz
 ing 3-D structures through dimensional reduction. The use of the Variation
 al Asymptotic Method (VAM) is explored for the systematic reduction of 3-D
  structures to 1-D models and further\, recover 3-D stresses and strains a
 fter solving the 1-D problem.\n\nA stiffness matching approach is proposed
  to dimensionally reduce 3-D features such as stiffeners by locally smeari
 ng them on the base plate. The proposed method allows for stiffeners of va
 rying dimensions\, topology\, and spacing to be smeared. The stiffness mat
 ching further allows the beam cross-sectional properties computed from VAM
  to be equal to a box-beam cross-section. The equivalence enables the use 
 of Euler-Bernoulli type analytical stiffness computation while retaining t
 he accuracy of VAM. Analytical expressions allow for rapid evaluation of t
 he beam properties and stress recovery and further permit the use of Autom
 atic Differentiation (AD) to obtain partial derivatives. The proposed stru
 ctural analysis method is applied to the wing structural analysis of a nov
 el distributed electric propulsion aircraft- NASA's PEGASUS concept\, and 
 the open-source CRM.\n\nA general adjoint method for dynamic simulations i
 s presented and applied to a nonlinear Timoshenko beam theory. It combines
  general beam residual equations with an adjoint method to extract gradien
 t information from the load time-history. Aggregated constraints implement
 ed for sizing are stress-based\, combining axial stresses at the beam corn
 ers with shear stresses from torsion and external loads at both corners an
 d mid-sections. CasASDi\, an open-source tool for nonlinear optimization a
 nd algorithmic differentiation\, is used to generate expressions and calcu
 late derivatives for the relevant equations used for analysis and optimiza
 tion. Numerical tests are conducted to test the accuracy of the adjoint co
 mputations and scalability as the number of design variables increase. A s
 tructural optimization framework is developed for the beam-based dynamic a
 nalysis method presented\, allowing for the structure's sizing under stren
 gth-based failure considerations. The PEGASUS concept is used as a testbed
  to demonstrate the sizing capabilities. The structure is sized for FARs s
 pecified maneuver loads– static 2.5g and -1.0g\, and dynamic gusts.\n\nF
 indings show that: 1) the use of VAM allows for the systematic extraction 
 of beam properties for aircraft wings\, 2) the displacement and stress res
 ponse of the aircraft using beam models match reasonably well against thos
 e produced by shell-based models\, 3) for dynamic simulations\, the derive
 d adjoint method computes accurate gradients efficiently to be used in str
 uctural optimization\, 4) sizing of aircraft wings for FARs specified mane
 uvers using the proposed approach produces a 6% error compared to the shel
 l-based method\, but with a 7.8x speed-up.\n\nThe proposed approach provid
 es improvements on the existing literature methods- it is computationally 
 efficient\, provides reasonable accuracy for early-stage structural sizing
  and weight prediction\, and includes dynamic effects. The computational e
 fficiency makes it well-suited for many-query applications like optimizati
 on\, uncertainty quantification\, and generating data for surrogate modeli
 ng.\n\nCommittee\n\n- Prof. Dimitri N. Mavris – School of Aerospace Engi

 tructured Environments"\n\nAbstract: Robotic systems have traditional been
  very successful in performing tasks where the inputs are well defined and
  known in advance. Automotive and electronic manufacturing are the classic
  success stories where robotic systems have demonstrated incredible value 
 for the industry. The tasks performed by the robots almost exclusively inv
 olve the manipulation or interacting with objects whose physical propertie
 s are known a priori and the objects are rigid and dry. In the many manufa
 cturing sectors\, robotic systems must be able to work in an unstructured 
 environment where every product is unique\, deformable and even wet. This 
 presentation will discuss various approaches to enable autonomous solution
 s to these problems. This will include software to minimize manual program
 ming of robots as well systems that integrate advanced perception and cont
 rol technologies to perform complex tasks like cutting\, grasping\, and ma
 nipulation.\n\nBio: Gary McMurray is a Principal Research Engineer and Div
 ision Chief for the Intelligent Sustainable Technologies Division at the G
 eorgia Tech Research Institute. He is also an Associate Director for the I
 nstitute for Robotics and Intelligent Machines (IRIM) at Georgia Tech. IRI
 M serves as an umbrella under which robotics researchers\, educators\, and
  students from across campus can come together to advance the many high-po
 wered and diverse robotics activities at Georgia Tech. The Intelligent Sus
 tainable Technologies Division conducts innovative research to improve the
  human condition through transforming the agricultural and food systems\, 
 sustainable use and access to energy and water\, and safety of people at w
 ork and from pandemics. Mr. McMurray’s research has focused on the devel
 opment of robotic technologies and solutions for the manufacturing and agr
 ibusiness communities\, including the protein and the fruit and vegetable 
 industries. He is an expert in visual servoing – the use of vision for t
 he real-time control of robotics\, and the author of over 50-refereed tech
 nical papers and journal publications in robotics.\n\nMr. McMurray serves 
 on the advisory board for Advanced Animal Systems for the Foundation of Fo
 od and Agricultural Research. He also serves on the Board of Directors for
  the Robotics Industry Association.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.edu/n

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Postdoc
 \, Public\, Undergraduate students\nStatus: published\n\nScheller Lunchtim
 e Live is a livestream series hosted by the Georgia Tech Scheller College 
 of Business featuring faculty\, student\, and alumni speakers discussing r
 elevant topics for the tech-driven\, digital age.\n\nFew took notice when 
 a fledgling electric-vehicle startup with a brash Elon Musk as CEO went pu
 blic in the summer of 2010 at a valuation of $2.24 billion. Fast forward t
 o early 2021\, and Tesla is valued at some $800 trillion\, which marks an 
 appreciation of roughly 36\,000%. Although Tesla made only 500\,000 vehicl
 es in 2020\, it is more valuable than the legacy carmakers such as Toyota\
 , Volkswagen\, GM\, and Ford combined\, producing over 25 million cars in 
 the same year. What is more\, most major car companies are now fully commi
 tted to an all-electric future. How did Tesla accomplish such a dramatic i
 ndustry transformation? How will it play out? How long will it take? What 
 sectors will be affected by the mobility transformation? Who are the winne
 rs\, and who are the losers? And\, perhaps most important\, what does this
  mean for you personally and professionally?\n\nJust hit "Attend event" on
  the LinkedIn event and visit the Georgia Tech Scheller College of Busines
 s page on Friday\, March 5 at 12:00 p.m. ET to access the session.\n\nAbou
 t Frank T. Rothaermel\n\nFrank T. Rothaermel is a Professor of Strategy & 
 Innovation\, holds the Russell and Nancy McDonough Chair in the Scheller C
 ollege of Business at Georgia Tech\, and is an Alfred P. Sloan Industry St
 udies Fellow. Bloomberg Businessweek named Frank one of Georgia Tech’s P
 rominent Faculty\, while Poets & Quants selected Frank as one of the “Fa
 vorite Business School Professors Teaching MBAs.” The Kauffman Foundatio
 n views Frank as one of the world’s 75 thought leaders in entrepreneursh
 ip and innovation. Based on having published papers in the top 1% based on
  citations\, Thomson Reuters identified Frank as one of the “world’s m
 ost influential scientific minds.”\n\nFrank is also the author of a lead

 K [1]\n\nIn this Lunch and Learn presentation\, we share how we have combi

 d dissolved oxygen in a range of culture systems such as multi-well cultur
 e plates\, microfluidics devices\, shake flasks\, and bioreactors.\n\nScie
 ntific Bioprocessing Inc. Presenters:\n\n- Jake Boy - Senior Application S
 cientist\n- Ian Sarad - Senior Bioprocessing Application Scientist\n\nPers
 onalized medicine in cell and gene therapy has moved therapeutics developm
 ent back to small scale bioreactors and added new process constraints: cos
 t and form factor. SBI has developed technologies that overcome these chal
 lenges and allow researchers to collect real-time sensing data with non-in
 vasive\, biocompatible\, sterilizable sensors.\n\nWe will also present our
  new fiber optic sensor platform that allows for sensing measurements insi
 de a bioreactor at multiple locatins in a perfusion flow loop upstream or 
 downstream of the bioreactor. This mapping can reveal stagnation zones\, i
 nsufficient mixing and other process improvement opportunities.\n\nWhile o
 vercoming form factor limitations is highly beneficial for personalized me
 dicine applications\, multi-sensing platforms are also critical in bioproc
 essing and in increasing reproducibility\, reducing cost\, and resulting i
 n better cell outcomes. We welcome the CMaT community to this presentation
  and offer evaluations of our technology to the CMaT researchers to encour
