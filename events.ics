 en Courthouse Archival Redrawn\n\nAbstract\n\nMies van der Rohe’s Everet
 t McKinley Dirksen United States Courthouse in Chicago built in 1964 is ar
 guably one of the most significant buildings in the history of judicial ar
 chitecture in the U.S. and abroad because of its transformative role in th
 e formulation of the conventions underlying contemporary courthouse design
 . Archived at the Museum of Modern Art New York (MoMA)\, a significant res
 ource associated with the design of the courthouse is the extensive docume
 ntation of the design process at the office of Mies. This body of work con
 sists of 135 sketches\, diagrams and drawings\, features alternative solut
 ions\, variational schemes\, and sectional innovations\, and provides an u
 ntapped resource to allow a closer look in the expressive range of the arc
 hitectural language and the technical innovations proposed by one of the g
 reatest architects of the twentieth century.\n\nThe work here takes on the
  Mies Archive and presents a formal reconstruction and automated completio
 n of the preliminary representations materializing the unrealized possibil
 ities embodied in the works. More specifically\, a generative description 
 of Mies’ courthouse design language is presented in the form of a shape 
 grammar implemented in the Shape Machine\, a pioneering recursive shape-re
 write technology developed at the Shape Computation Lab at the Georgia Ins
 titute of Technology. The grammar is proposed as an open-ended set of shap
 e rules that is readily expanded to complete the sets of design variations
  documented in the archive\, along with several possible ones that can be 
 in principle generated by the evolving grammar. Significantly\, all new sh
 ape rules are introduced seamlessly\, as an intrinsic part of the design p
 rocess of the evolving grammar\, without requiring reformatting of existin
 g rules or advocating the design of a singular Miesian grammar.\n\nThe wor
 k aims to provide (a) a generative model of Mies’ courthouse design lang
 uage\; (b) an automated completion of some of the rudimentary sketches\, d
 iagrams and drawings in the Mies Archive at MoMA\; (c) a prototype of an i
 nteractive design system for courthouse design that architects\, designers
  and stakeholders of courthouse architecture can evaluate for practical us
 e\; and (d) some speculations on the transformative role of the proposed c
 omputational method in bridging the gap between sketching and drafting in 
 the digital workflows of architects and designers.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://

 Evolutionary Transitions in Individuality (ETIs) describe the history of t
 he increasing complexity of life and the emergence of hierarchical organiz
 ation in an elegant framework. Each transition is characterized by a group
  of independent individuals coming together and forming a group that event
 ually can undergo Darwinian evolution and turns into a new individual leve
 l. One of the prominent examples of ETIs is the emergence of multicellular
 ity. In this thesis\, I address two key questions about the transition to 
 multicellularity: The emergence of heritability of higher-level traits and
  its relationship to cell-level traits. First\, I discuss how the heritabi
 lity of newly-formed group traits emerges as groups emerge. We introduce a
  simple theoretical model for calculating group-level trait heritability\,
  where the trait is the linear function of a cell-level trait. For cases i
 n which the relationship is more complex than a linear function\, we devel
 oped a statistical simulation to model and explore different kinds of anal
 ytical functions based on biological examples of relationship between cell
 -level traits and collective-level traits. Finally\, using the snowflake y
 east model system we did an experiment that shows an ecologically relevant
 \, emergent trait in a nascent multicellular organism can have a higher he
 ritability across a range of conditions than the unicellular-level trait o
 n which it is based. The evolution of complex multicellularity presents an
  apparent paradox: nascent multicellular organisms are thought to require 
 (relatively) large size to evolve complex traits\, but at the same time ma
 intaining large size requires complex organization at the cell and group l
 evels. This poses a chicken and egg problem between large size and cellula
 r development. Here\, we show that over the course of a year snowflake yea
 st can increase its size multiple orders of magnitude with minimal change 
 at the cell level by taking advantage of the physical properties of granul
 ar entangled materials. These results suggest that in the same way that ph
 ysically imposed geometric constraints can limit the size of clusters\, an
 -other innovations can lead to the emergence of a new biophysical mechanis
 m that changes the material properties of the clusters.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  ht

 tion Abstract:\n\nShape grammar interpreters have been studied for more th
 an forty years addressing several areas of design research including archi
 tectural\, engineering\, and product design. At the core of all these impl
 ementations\, the operation of embedding – the ability of a shape gramma
 r interpreter to search for subshapes in a geometry model even if they are
  not explicitly encoded in the database of the system – resists a genera
 l solution. It is suggested here that beyond a seemingly long list of tech
 nological hurdles\, the implementation of shape embedding\, that is\, the 
 implementation of the mathematical concept of the “part relation” betw
 een two shapes\, or equivalently\, between two drawings\, or between a sha
 pe and a design\, is the single major obstacle to take on.\n\nThis researc
 h identifies five challenges underlying the implementation of shape embedd
 ing and shape grammar interpreters at large: 1) complex entanglement of th
 e calculations required for shape embedding and a shape grammar interprete
 r at large\, with those required by a CAD system for modeling and modifyin
 g geometry\; 2) accumulated errors caused by the modeling processes of CAD
  systems\; 3) accumulated errors caused by the complex calculations requir
 ed for the derivation of affine\, and mostly\, perspectival transformation
 s\; 4) limited support for indeterminate shape embedding\; 5) low performa
 nce of the current shape embedding algorithms for models consisting of a l
 arge number of shapes.\n\nThe dissertation aims to provide a comprehensive
  engineering solution to all these five challenges above. More specificall
 y\, the five contributions of the dissertation are: 1) a new architecture 
 to separate the calculations required for the shape embedding and replacem
 ent (appropriately called here Shape Machine) vs. the calculations require
 d by a CAD system for the selection\, instantiation\, transformation\, and
  combination of shapes in CAD modeling\; 2) a new modeling calibration sys
 tem to ensure the effective translation of geometrical types of shapes to 
 their maximal representations without cumulative calculating errors\; 3) a
  new dual-mode system of the derivation of transformations for shape embed
 ding\, including a geometric approach next to the known algebraic one\, to
  implement the shape embedding relation under the full spectrum of linear 
 transformations without the accumulated errors caused by the current algor
 ithms\; 4) a new multi-step mechanism that resolves all cases of indetermi
 nate embeddings for shapes having fewer registration points than those req
 uired for a shape embedding under a particular type of transformation\; an
 d 5) a new data representation for hyperplane intersections\, the registra
 tion point signature\, to allow for the effective calculation of shape emb
 eddings for complex drawings consisting of a large number of shapes. All m
 odules are integrated into a common computational framework to test the mo
 del for a particular type of shapes – the shapes consisting of lines in 
 the Euclidean plane in the algebra U 12.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.

 e State Performance using Time-varying Functional Connectivity Methods.\n\
 nAbstract:\n\nTo successfully achieve our goals and perform optimally in m
 any tasks\, we need to control our attention and sustain it. Some people t
 hink of attention as a light switch – it’s either on or off\, but a be
 tter metaphor is to equate attention to a candle that flickers –even whe
 n it is lit\, its flame varies. This is reflected in subjective accounts o
 f people claiming to feel focused or “in the zone” from one moment to 
 being “zoned-out” in another. Early studies of sustained attention usi
 ng fMRI compute correlation across the duration of the scan for regions of
  the brain which can last from minutes up to an hour. This assumption is p
 roblematic because like a flickering candle\, researchers have found evide
 nce of moment-to-moment fluctuations in the neural systems of attention (C
 hang & Glover\, 2010\; Majeed et al.\, 2011\; Liu & Dyun\, 2013). As a res
 ult\, there has been contradictive studies claiming that large-scale netwo
 rks like default mode network (DMN) and task positive network (TPN) can bo
 th support and be detrimental to performance.\n\nTo tackle this limitation
 \, this study will employ two methods of time-varying functional connectiv
 ity\, co-activation patterns (CAPs) and quasi periodic-pattern (QPP) to ex
 amine the interaction between the large-scale brain networks that are invo
 lved in zone state performance during a finger tapping task. The first lev
 el of analysis\, using CAPs\, aims to investigate moment-to-moment fluctua
 tions in the attention networks within an individual. The main prediction 
 is that there will be certain brain states that are more prevalent in in-t
 he-zone epochs and others that are more prevalent in out-of-the-zone epoch
 s. The second level analysis\, using QPP\, seeks to identify differences i
 n stable performance versus unstable performance across time within an ind
 ividual. I hypothesize that DMN and the TPN will be more anti-correlated i
 n in-the-zone runs than out-of-the-zone runs within a subject.\n\nIf the r
 esults are as predicted\, it elucidates how inter-regional functional conn
 ectivity supports sustained attention within an individual. This can lead 
 us to a better neural mechanistic understanding of what facilitates attent
 ion in order to achieve better performance.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gate

 ght/Guggenheim 317 and on BlueJeans: [1]\n\nAbstract\nThe majority of syst
 ems in nature have a spatio-temporal dependence and can be described by Pa
 rtial Differential Equations (PDEs). They are ubiquitous in science and en
 gineering\, and are of rising interest among the control\, robotics\, and 
 machine learning communities. Related methods usually treat these infinite
  dimensional problems in finite dimensions with reduced order models. This
  leads to committing to specific approximation schemes and the subsequent 
 control laws cannot generalize outside of the approximation schemes. Addit
 ionally\, related work does not consider spatio-temporal descriptions of n
 oise that realistically represent the stochastic nature of physical system
 s. This thesis develops a variety of approaches for control optimization a
 nd co-design optimization for PDE and stochastic PDE (SPDE) systems from a
  unified perspective that can be applied to macroscopic systems in robotic
 s and fluid dynamics\, as well as microscopic systems in quantum mechanics
 . These approaches are each developed completely in the infinite dimension
 al Hilbert spaces where the systems are mathematically described\, enablin
 g the frameworks to be agnostic to the discretization scheme used to imple
 ment them. The first three developed approaches are applied in simulation 
 to classical systems in fluid mechanics such as the Heat and Burgers equat
 ion. The fourth approach is developed for second-order SPDEs that arise in
  robotic systems\, and are applied in simulation to systems in soft-roboti
 cs such as the Euler-Bernoulli equation and a biological model of a soft-r
 obotic limb. Finally\, several approaches are developed in the context of 
 quantum feedback control of open quantum systems with non-demolition measu
 rement\, and one such approach is applied in simulation to perform explici
 t feedback control of the two qubit open quantum system.\n\nCommittee\n\n-

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Public\
 , Undergraduate students\nStatus: published\n\nAvani Gupta\n[Advisor: Prof
 . Lakshmi Sankar]\n\nwill defend a doctoral thesis entitled\n\nApplication
  of an Extended Messinger Model for Ice Accretion on Complex Geometries\n\
 nOn\n\nThursday\, September 23 at 1 PM\n\nMontgomery Knight 317\n\nhttps:/
 /bluejeans.com/568440634/5222\n\nAbstract\nIce accretion can significantly
  degrade the performance\, stability\, availability\, and affordability of
  an airborne vehicle. It is imperative that this phenomenon be modeled acc
 urately. While ice accretion studies have been performed on airplane wings
 \, propellers\, and helicopter blades\, there are very few attempts to mod
 el the process on more complex geometries such as fuselages. In this study
 \, an existing in-house Extended Messinger methodology is generalized for 
 complex geometries by modeling the flow field and water droplet transport 
 on unstructured grids\, and carrying out the ice accretion calculations al
 ong surface streamlines.\n\nA general framework has been developed\, allow
 ing the use of two-dimensional and three-dimensional\, structured\, and un
 structured\, public domain and commercial CFD analyses. The methodology is
  primarily spilt into three steps: the continuum flow field analysis\, the
  dispersed water phase computations\, and the ice accretion module. In the
  present study\, in-house methodologies as well as commercial solvers such
  as STAR-CCM+ and ANSYS Fluent have been used for the flow field and dropl
 et dispersed phase computations. The in-house methodologies for the disper
 sed water droplet transport are done using an Eulerian approach\, with a o
 ne-way interaction between the air flow and the dispersed phase via the dr
 ag force exerted on the droplets by the air flow. The ice accretion is car
 ried out along surface streamlines\, or optionally along two-dimensional s
 ection cuts\, using an in-house icing methodology based on the Extended-Me
 ssinger model.\n\nThe predictions from the present approach are compared t
 o available experimental data\, and predictions using other solvers such a
 s LEWICE and STAR-CCM+. Several configurations with varying levels of comp
 lexity are modeled. These include 2-D airfoils\, swept wings\, and helicop
 ter fuselage configurations. Time and space sensitivity studies have been 
 done.\n\nCommittee\n\n- Prof. Lakshmi Sankar – School of Aerospace Engin

 eeting ID: 902 753 700 2\n\nThe evolution of complex aerospace vehicles tr
 aced with the progression of novel missions and state of the art technolog
 y has forged a continuous need for adapted or new vehicles. This sequence 
 introduces more uncertainties into the process of design. With more source
 s and unknowns\, the uncertainty of early design decision-making becomes l
 ess distinguishable and difficult to address. A matter of reducing and mit
 igating risks due to these uncertainties is a significant complication in 
 requirements definition and conceptual design phases for novel vehicle def
 initions. The inaccessibility and inapplicable nature of historical data\,
  along with sparsity of experts for each next generation of vehicles\, mak
 es this task even harder. This leaves the industry with a gap in managing 
 the compounding uncertainties in setting performance constraints and risk 
 mitigation strategies without accessible data or expertise.\n\nA prime exa
 mple of lessons learned can be found in the Space Transportation System Ve
 hicle (STS-1). The program required significant risk mitigation when the a
 erodynamic loading on the wings of the orbiter introduced 30-40% higher st
 ructural loads than designed to withstand. Since then\, the field of desig
 n has evolved significantly into the state-of-the-art multidisciplinary de
 sign and integrated modeling and simulation methods. The basis the existin
 g conceptual design process sets enables uncertainty reduction through kno
 wledge of performance and quantitative decision-making.\n\nTo address the 
 aspects of uncertainty often overlooked or ignored\, this research propose
 s an augmentation of the existing conceptual design environment. The focus
  will be to enable uncertainty characterization of the design assumptions\
 , and modeling qualities\, for uncertainty-informed risk mitigation that r
 educes the risks of rework due to variation in the design and under-predic
 ted phenomena from reduced modeling approximations. The methodology propos
 ed within this research hypothesizes an uncertainty threshold scenario-bas
 ed approach for dependent performance enveloping and margin allocation. It
  is proposed to demonstrate this method on the case study of approximating
  the dynamic modal deflections of a publicly available Launch Vehicle mode
 l under the approximation between low-fidelity dynamics and full-scale fle
 xible body dynamics.\n\n- Prof. Dimitri Mavris – School of Aerospace Eng

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Public\, Undergraduate stud
 ents\nExtras: Free food\nStatus: published\n\nRSVP now to attend "National
 ist Backlash Against Foreign Climate Shaming" with Dr. Umberto Mignozzetti
  [1]. Mignozetti is a Visiting Assistant Professor at Emory University in 
 the Quantitative Theory and Methods Department. The event will be both in-
 person and online via BlueJeans. For in-person attendees\, a meal will be 
 provided. Due to the capacity of the room\, only 20 in-person guests will 
 be allowed. The in-person version of the event will be held at the West Vi
 llage Dining Commons in the Ensemble Room. RSVP here [2] to reserve your s
 pot.\n\nEvent abstract:\nShould international pro-climate actors speak up 
 against climate rogues? Or do foreign critics risk igniting nationalist ba
 cklash against global environmental norms? We explore naming and shaming d
 ynamics in global climate politics by fielding survey experiments to natio
 nally representative samples in Brazil. Our results confirm the theoretica
 l expectation that nationalism moderates how mass publics react to foreign
  climate shaming: individuals who are highly attached to their nation are 
 more likely to reject international criticism than their lowly attached pe
 ers. Yet\, in contrast to theoretical expectations\, we show that national
 ist publics prefer to reject foreign criticism rather than virulently defy
  the critical message. Our findings hold irrespective of the source of cri
 ticism (that is\, whether the critic is an allied nation or a geopolitical
  adversary)\, and the nature of the critical message (that is\, whether th
 e cue is couched in cosmopolitan language or not). These results sound a c
 autionary note on the belief that liberal internationalists should tread c
 arefully so as not to unadvisedly unleash nationalist\, neo-populist\, or 
 "antiglobalist" pushback. While pro-climate foreign critics may well bump 
 up against nationalist sentiment in climate rogues no matter who they are 
 or how they speak\, climate criticism will not necessarily fuel an all-out
  backlash against global environmental norms and institutions.\n\nLinks:\n

 \nProfessor Cheng-Chien Chen | Department of Physics\, University of Alaba
 ma at Birmingham\nAbstract: Super-hard materials exhibit a Vickers hardnes
 s H ≥ 40 GPa\, and they have extensive industrial and technological appl
 ications. Due to the huge search space of possible element combinations\, 
 it is challenging to explore new superhard ternary or quaternary materials
 . In this talk\, I will first discuss machine learning (ML) discovery of n
 ew superhard B-C-N and B-N-O compounds. The ML results are validated by ev
 olutionary structure prediction and density functional theory (DFT). In pa
 rticular\, the proposed BC10N has a low formation energy and a high hardne
 ss H ~ 86 GPa only next to diamond. In the second part of the talk\, I wil
 l discuss calculations of entropy formation ability (EFA) using both DFT a
 nd ML for 5-metal hexagonal high-entropy borides. The calculations indicat
 e that EFA serves as a good descriptor for the synthesizability of high-en
 tropy materials\, some of which have superior mechanical properties promis
 ing for applications in extreme environments.\n\nBio: Cheng-Chien Chen rec
 eived his Ph.D. in Physics from Stanford University in\, 2011. Afterwards 
 he became a Postdoctoral Scholar at the SLAC National Accelerator Laborato
 ry and later an Aneesur Rahman Postdoctoral Fellow at the Argonne National
  Laboratory. He joined the Department of Physics at the University of Alab
 ama at Birmingham (UAB) as an Assistant Professor in 2016. He is currently
  a Leadership Resource Allocation (LRAC) Awardee to use the NSF-funded Fro
 ntera Supercomputer and an NSF EPSCoR Research Fellow. Dr. Chen’s expert
 ise lies in using quantum many-body simulations\, first-principles calcula
 tions\, and machine learning approaches to model and predict the propertie
 s of various quantum and functional materials.\n\nPlease register by Septe

 stract:\n\nAnimals must execute robust\, agile movement in a variety of bi
 omechanical and environmental contexts. The nervous system must encode inf
 ormation for movement across multiple muscles in the "all-or-none" message
 s of action potentials. Sequences of action potentials\, or spikes\, can c
 arry information in the number of spikes and their timing. Spike timing co
 des are critical in many sensory systems\, but there is now growing eviden
 ce that millisecond-scale changes in timing also carry information in moto
 r brain regions\, descending decision-making circuits\, and individual mot
 or units. However\, a thorough investigation of the importance of spike ti
 ming at the millisecond-scale for encoding information\, coordinating musc
 les\, and causally changing motor behavior would require recording a compr
 ehensive\, spike-resolved motor program across a complete set of muscles t
 hat actuate a behavior.\n\nThis work leverages the comprehensive\, spike-r
 esolved motor program of the hawk moth to demonstrate that the currency of
  motor control is millisecond-scale precise spike timings. We show that ac
 ross the ten muscles that control the wings during flight\, spike timing e
 ncodes more information about yaw torque than spike rate\, and that spike 
 timing encodes all coordinated information between pairs of muscles\, desp
 ite there being sufficient bandwidth to encode the information in spike ra
 te. We introduce a method to assess the necessary spike timing precision t
 o encode information about behavior. In the comprehensive motor program of
  the hawk moth\, the information encoded in spikes is precise to the milli
 second or sub-millisecond scale\, losing information when noise is added t
 o spikes that exceeds several milliseconds. We demonstrate through classif
 ication that the motor program we record is indeed comprehensive\, capable
  of near perfect classification of six types of behavior elicited in respo
 nse to drifting visual stimuli as long as millisecond-scale information ab
 out spikes is available. Additionally\, we demonstrate consistency in how 
 muscles are coordinated across different types of behavior\, though functi
 onally different spiking activity occurs. Finally\, we investigate specifi
 c precise spike timing differences observed in the six behavior types to d
 emonstrate causality of millisecond-scale spike timing for behavior.\n\nLi

 \n\nAbstract:\nGiven a collection of observations and a class of models\, 
 the objective of a typical unsupervised learning algorithm is to find the 
 model in the class that best fits the data. However\, real datasets are ty
 pically exposed to some source of noise. Robust statistics focuses on the 
 design of outlier-robust estimators — algorithms that can tolerate a con
 stant fraction of corrupted data points or other small departures from mod
 el assumptions\, independent of the dimension. In the outlier-robust setti
 ng\, it is challenging to develop efficient learning algorithms for many w
 ell-known high-dimensional models.\n\nWe give an efficient algorithm for t
 he problem of robustly learning Gaussian mixtures. The main tools are an e
 fficient partial clustering algorithm that relies on the sum-of-squares me
 thod\, and a novel tensor decomposition algorithm that allows errors in bo
 th Frobenius norm and low-rank terms. I will also discuss the problems of 
 robustly learning affine transformations and robustly learning multi-view 
 models\, and the possible approaches to solve these problems: e.g.\, robus
 t tensor decomposition.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.edu/node/650757#0

 568440634/5222\n\nAbstract\nIce accretion can significantly degrade the pe
 rformance\, stability\, availability\, and affordability of an airborne ve
 hicle. It is imperative that this phenomenon be modeled accurately. While 
 ice accretion studies have been performed on airplane wings\, propellers\,
  and helicopter blades\, there are very few attempts to model the process 
 on more complex geometries such as fuselages. In this study\, an existing 
 in-house Extended Messinger methodology is generalized for complex geometr
 ies by modeling the flow field and water droplet transport on unstructured
  grids\, and carrying out the ice accretion calculations along surface str
 eamlines.\n\nA general framework has been developed\, allowing the use of 
 two-dimensional and three-dimensional\, structured\, and unstructured\, pu
 blic domain and commercial CFD analyses. The methodology is primarily spil
 t into three steps: the continuum flow field analysis\, the dispersed wate
 r phase computations\, and the ice accretion module. In the present study\
 , in-house methodologies as well as commercial solvers such as STAR-CCM+ a
 nd ANSYS Fluent have been used for the flow field and droplet dispersed ph
 ase computations. The in-house methodologies for the dispersed water dropl
 et transport are done using an Eulerian approach\, with a one-way interact
 ion between the air flow and the dispersed phase via the drag force exerte
 d on the droplets by the air flow. The ice accretion is carried out along 
 surface streamlines\, or optionally along two-dimensional section cuts\, u
 sing an in-house icing methodology based on the Extended-Messinger model.\
 n\nThe predictions from the present approach are compared to available exp
 erimental data\, and predictions using other solvers such as LEWICE and ST
 AR-CCM+. Several configurations with varying levels of complexity are mode
 led. These include 2-D airfoils\, swept wings\, and helicopter fuselage co
 nfigurations. Time and space sensitivity studies have been done.\n\nCommit

 als in Stein 5-5:30pm after the talk.\n\nDr. Grover’s research activitie
 s in process systems engineering focus on understanding macromolecular org
 anization and the emergence of biological function. Discrete atoms and mol
 ecules interact to form macromolecules and even larger mesoscale assemblie
 s\, ultimately yielding macroscopic structures and properties. A quantitat
 ive relationship between the nanoscale discrete interactions and the macro
 scale properties is required to design\, optimize\, and control such syste
 ms\; yet in many applications\, predictive models do not exist or are comp
 utationally intractable.\n\nThe Grover group [1] is dedicated to the devel
 opment of tractable and practical approaches for the engineering of macros
 cale behavior via explicit consideration of molecular and atomic scale int
 eractions. We focus on applications involving the kinetics of self-assembl
 y\, specifically those in which methods from non-equilibrium statistical m

 kable opportunities we have to improve the lives of others through our car
 eers\, followed by a lengthy Q&A session. There will be free samosas and s
 nacks!\n\nOne possible approach to doing good is "earning to give". Someon
 e in the US earning $65K/year—which is already more than the income of 9
 9% of people in the world—would be able to save dozens of lives over the
  course of their career by donating to effective charities such as the Aga
 inst Malaria Foundation. This is an incredible amount of impact! But anoth
 er option which is likely even more impactful is applying our skills in CS
  to directly work on pressing global problems\, and ultimately have a more
  meaningful and fulfilling career.\n\nEffective altruism is a global movem
 ent centered around how we can use evidence and reason to help us do the m
 ost good we can\, given our limited time and resources. You can learn more
  about Effective Altruism at GT on its website https://eagatech.org/ [1]\,
  subscribe to its mailing list at http://eepurl.com/hHt6vr [2]\, and join

  CS Careers Club is dedicated to forming a space where GT students interes

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Public\
 , Undergraduate students\nStatus: draft\n\nAbstract:\n\nWith the rise and 
 proliferation of gig economy platforms providing ride hailing\, food deliv
 ery and other app-based services on-demand in major urban centers of the w
 orld\, there have been major transformations in work and life globally. Gi
 g platforms have certainly disrupted and redefined the discovery and alloc
 ation of casual work through algorithmic management\, creating grave conce
 rns for regulating the future of work. Simultaneously\, especially in the 
 global South\, gig platforms have also emerged as important avenues for ga
 ining temporary paid work and socio-economic mobility for low income indiv
 iduals\, women and migrant workers. Drawing on over five years of ethnogra
 phic research with a variety of stakeholders in the gig economy including 
 workers\, managers\, consumers and regulators\, my work shows how platform
 ization produces heterogeneous effects on the lives\, livelihoods and prod
 uctive and reproductive capacities of different individuals in urban India
 . This talk will draw on multiple case studies of gig work to show these h
 eterogeneous effects and how everyday technology practice also informs pla
 tform design in return. I will also offer some considerations for HCI scho
 lars looking to study the effects of emerging technologies in global South
  settings.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\nNoopur Raval is a postdoctoral researcher at
  the AI Now Institute and an adjunct professor at the Tandon School of Eng
 ineering at New York University. She received her PhD in Informatics from 
 UC Irvine in 2020 and is a tech ethnographer and interdisciplinary scholar
  at the intersection of HCI\, Communication and Media Studies\, Cultural A
 nthropology and Postcolonial History. She has written extensively on gig w
 ork\, platformization and the future of work in the global South. Her new 
 work extends to studying the cultural labor and subjective decision-making
  by global South data annotators in order to train AI/ML systems. Her work
  has appeared in CSCW\, CHI\, ACM Interactions among other venues. She has
  also worked in UX research at multiple Microsoft Research labs. Noopur is
  an alumna of the Berkman-Klein Center for Internet & Society at Harvard U
 niversity and the Center for Tech\, Society and Policy at UC Berkeley.\n\n

SUMMARY:Nano@Tech | Creative Epitaxy: Finding Ways to Violate Assumptions

 \, Public\, Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\nStatus: published\n
 \nProf. W. Alan Doolittle\; School of Electrical and Computer Engineering\
 , Georgia Institute of Technology\nAbstract: Epitaxial processes are consi
 dered routine for applications spanning established industries from the si
 licon and GaN semiconductor industries to cutting edge research. As many a
 s 10\,000 epitaxial reactors crank out billions of dollars’ worth of lig
 ht emitting diode chips for solid state white lighting alone. Those metric
 s increase 100-fold for silicon applications. Epitaxy is core to countless
  industries but is mostly performed in ways that have not changed for deca
 des. But epitaxy can also be performed in non-standard ways to overcome 
 “perceived” barriers to materials synthesis. Several examples will be 
 given in this talk including: 1) Dynamic control of surface chemistry so a
 s to enable higher solubility of desirable impurities\; 2) Dynamic control
  of surface energy facilitating 3D control of alloy composition and materi
 al properties\; 3) Electrothermal control of epitaxy to enable metastable 
 phase materials\; and 4) the “invention” of the widest semiconductor k
 nown. Each of these example problems has been solved by a common “though
 t process” wherein the fundamental assumption behind the limitation was 
 defined and ways of violating the identified assumption was explored leadi
 ng to new functionality in materials. The importance of the process – as
 sumption identification and violation – will be discussed in hopes of co
 nveying an important approach to solving hard problems. New emerging indus
 tries such as optoelectronics\, neuromorphic computing and power electroni
 cs will be highlighted as beneficiaries of these unique approaches.\n\nBio
 : Dr. W. Alan Doolittle is the Joseph M. Pettit professor in the School of
  Electrical and Computer Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology. D
 oolittle is a proud\, two-time Georgia Tech alumnus\, earning his B.E.E. d
 egree with highest honors in 1989 and his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering 
 in 1996. Doolittle leads the Advanced Semiconductor Technology Facility wi
 th an estimated equipment capitalization of $8 million and works in the ar
 eas of microelectronic fabrication\, materials growth\, materials and devi
 ce characterization\, neuromorphic computational devices\, power devices\,
  high frequency transistors and optoelectronic devices. Doolittle pioneere
 d the area of hyper doping of wide bandgap semiconductors which has enable
 d the creation of new semiconductors including the widest bandgap semicond
 uctor known\, new devices that utilize quantum mechanical processes to red
 uce power losses and to allow new ways of interconnecting advanced power a
 nd optoelectronic devices. Doolittle has also pioneered the synthesis of l
 ithium-metal-oxides which have recently gained attraction for very low pow
 er neuromorphic devices– devices that emulate human brain functionality.

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Graduate students\, Undergraduate students\
 nExtras: Free Food\nStatus: published\n\nFirst meeting of the semester for
  Effective Altruism at Georgia Tech! We'll have a presentation providing a
 n overview of effective altruism and our upcoming Effective Altruism Semin
 ar program! Free food will be provided afterwards for us to eat together o
 utdoors.\n\nEffective altruism is an ongoing research field that aims to f
 ind the best ways to improve the world\, through the use of evidence and c
 areful reasoning. It’s also a community of people who strive to take act
 ion on that basis\, and to do the most good we can. Here’s an article ex
 plaining this in much more detail: Introduction to Effective Altruism [2]\
 n\nAt Effective Altruism at Georgia Tech [3]\, we try to apply the princip
 les of effective altruism to help interested students have as big of a soc
 ial impact as they can with their lives\; whether that’s pursuing a soci
 al impact career that tackles a key pressing global problem\, or through d
 onating to highly effective charities. If this sounds interesting to you\,
  feel free to subscribe to our mailing list [4] and we'll keep you in the 
 loop.\n\nIf attending in-person\, we strongly encourage each attendee to w
 ear a face mask covering their nose and mouth while indoors. A face mask w
 ill be provided if you do not have one. Please attend virtually if you hav
 e symptoms of COVID-19 such as fever or cough.\n\nLocation: Skiles 154 or

 \, Medicine Madness on a yearly basis\, but this year wants to be more inc
 lusive! Therefore we are hosting the AMSA Olympics\, with modified Olympic
  games. Modified Olympic games include a pool noodle javelin throw\, dodge
 ball\, a paper airplane toss\, ring toss\, and more! It should be lots of 
 fun and require no athleticism!\n\nThe event will occur on January 22nd! A
 MSA Olympics will take place from approximately 9AM to 12PM with lunch and
  awards served soon after! Medicine Madness will occur in the afternoon fo
 llowing lunch!\n\nTeams will be 3-4 people\, but if you do not have a team
 \, do not worry! We will match you with teammates the day of the event! Th
 ere is no limit to the number of teams for AMSA Olympics\, but there is a 
 maximum of 8 teams for Medicine Madness so register early if you want to s
 ecure your spot!\n\nThe last day to sign up is 1/16 at 11:59 PM! [1]\n\nLi

 \nMark Moll Ph.D. | Director of Research\, PickNik Robotics\nAbstract: Rob
 ot manipulators are increasingly deployed outside of carefully controlled 
 factory settings. Advances in robot motion planning have made it possible 
 to compute feasible motions for more complex systems. My work is focused o
 n enabling planning over varying time horizons subject to complex soft and
  hard constraints. The goal is to reduce the amount of user input required
  to command a robot and enable ever greater levels of autonomy. In this pr
 esentation I will first give a brief overview of sampling-based motion pla
 nning\, a class of methods that has been successfully applied to a broad r
 ange of complex systems. I will present recent results that show that sati
 sfying hard constraints can be decoupled from the particular planning stra
 tegy\, which can lead to surprising performance improvements. Next\, I wil
 l present some results on using hyperparameter optimization to select and 
 tune motion planning algorithms for a given robot. Finally\, will present 
 some initial results on supervised autonomy that combines motion planning 
 with compliant control\, perception\, and human input.\n\nBio: Mark Moll r
 eceived an M.S. in Computer Science from the University of Twente in the N
 etherlands and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University
 . Mark Moll is currently the Director of Research at PickNik\, a robotics 
 software development and consultancy company that is supporting the MoveIt
  motion planning framework. Previously\, he was a senior research scientis
 t in the Computer Science Department at Rice University. He has worked in 
 robotics for more than 20 years\, with a focus on motion planning. He has 
 led the development of the Open Motion Planning Library (OMPL)\, which is 
 widely used in industry and academic research (often via MoveIt / ROS). He
  has over 80 peer-reviewed publications with research contributions in app
 lied algorithms for problems in robotics and computational structural biol
 ogy. He has extensive experience deploying novel algorithms on a variety o
 f robotic platforms\, ranging from NASA’s Robonaut 2 to autonomous under
 water vehicles and self-reconfigurable robots.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.g

 e a comprehensive approach to social innovation encouraging students to be
  compassionate listeners\; identify and build on the assets\; research the
  solution landscape to learn from both what works and what failed\; take a
  systems approach to identify the root cause versus the symptoms of the is
 sue.\n\nStudents who aspire to work closely with and learn from a communit
 y partner/civic entrepreneur\, those who want to affect change in the Unit
 ed Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs)\, and those who are wond
 ering how they can make a real\, lasting\, and appropriate difference in o
 ther people’s lives are ideal candidates for I2S.\n\nIn the 2022 season\
 , student teams will learn from and work with our Atlanta area community p
 artners and civic entrepreneurs. A series of hands-on workshops and discus
 sions\, complemented by conversations with experts from the frontlines\, w
 ill equip participants with broadly relevant problem discovery tools and s
 kills that they can apply in any field and career. The workshops are offer
 ed as part of the MGT4803 Social Impact course and they are open to any st
 udent interested.\n\nThe deliverable for I2S is a Stakeholder Map of the s
 ocial issue student teams explore with their community partner's guidance.
  The I2S Showcase will take place on April 18 where teams will present the
  outcome of their work to an audience of practitioners\, community leaders
 \, faculty\, and students.\n\nParticipating I2S Teams can apply to the Map
  the System Global Challenge [1] as a part of our collaboration with the S
 koll Center for Social Entrepreneurship at the Saïd Business School at Ox
 ford. The top team(s) from I2S will represent Georgia Tech at Oxford and c

 nExtras: Free food\nStatus: published\n\nThis is a weekly workshop series 
 for Ideas to Serve participants. This week we explore finding data with So
 cial Explorer.\n\nWe take a comprehensive approach to social innovation en
 couraging students to be compassionate listeners\; identify and build on t
 he assets\; research the solution landscape to learn from both what works 
 and what failed\; take a systems approach to identify the root cause versu
 s the symptoms of the issue.\n\nStudents who aspire to work closely with a
 nd learn from a community partner/civic entrepreneur\, those who want to a
 ffect change in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs)\
 , and those who are wondering how they can make a real\, lasting\, and app
 ropriate difference in other people’s lives are ideal candidates for I2S
 .\n\nIn the 2022 season\, student teams will learn from and work with our 
 Atlanta area community partners and civic entrepreneurs. A series of hands
 -on workshops and discussions\, complemented by conversations with experts
  from the frontlines\, will equip participants with broadly relevant probl
 em discovery tools and skills that they can apply in any field and career.
  The workshops are offered as part of the MGT4803 Social Impact course and
  they are open to any student interested.\n\nThe deliverable for I2S is a 
 Stakeholder Map of the social issue student teams explore with their commu
 nity partner's guidance. The I2S Showcase will take place on April 18 wher
 e teams will present the outcome of their work to an audience of practitio
 ners\, community leaders\, faculty\, and students.\n\nParticipating I2S Te
 ams can apply to the Map the System Global Challenge [1] as a part of our 
 collaboration with the Skoll Center for Social Entrepreneurship at the Sa
 ïd Business School at Oxford. The top team(s) from I2S will represent Geo
 rgia Tech at Oxford and compete with teams focused on social impact from t
 op universities around the world.\n\nLearn more about our community partne

 e Live is a livestream series hosted by the Georgia Tech Scheller College 
 of Business featuring faculty\, student\, and alumni speakers discussing r
 elevant topics for the tech-driven\, digital age.\n\nEmerging technologies
  can change the business and societal environment rapidly and dramatically
 . In this session\, Scheller Professor Eric Overby will present a structur
 ed method for analyzing an emerging technology using 3-D printed houses as
  an example.\n\nJust hit "Attend" on this LinkedIn event and refresh this 
 page on Friday\, February 25 at 12:00 p.m. ET to access the session. Pleas
 e note\, you must have a LinkedIn profile in order to register and view th
 e livestream.\n\nAbout Eric Overby\n\nDr. Eric Overby joined the Scheller 
 College of Business faculty in the fall of 2007 after completing his Ph.D 
 at Emory University. He is currently the Catherine and Edward Wahlen profe
 ssor of Information Technology Management.\n\nEric's research has appeared
  in academic journals such as Management Science\, Information Systems Res
 earch\, MIS Quarterly\, Organization Science\, Journal of Management Infor
 mation Systems\, and the European Journal of Information Systems. His rese
 arch has received awards from scholarly organizations such as INFORMS and 
 the Academy of Management including the Best Published Paper of 2008 award
  and the Best Program Paper of 2010 award from the Organizational Communic
 ation and Information Systems division of the Academy of Management. He re
 ceived the Sandy Slaughter Early Career Award from the INFORMS Information
  System Society in 2015.\n\nHe also received the Linda and Lloyd Byars Awa
 rd for Faculty Research Excellence from the Scheller College in 2015\, and
  he was one of three finalists for the Association for Computing Machinery
 's SIGMIS Best Dissertation Award in 2007. Eric was one of two recipients 
 (out of 221 junior faculty) of Georgia Tech's university-wide Junior Facul
 ty Teaching Excellence award in 2011 and was the first Scheller College fa
 culty member to receive this award since 1993. He also received the James 
 F. Frazier\, Jr. Award for Teaching Excellence in 2011. Eric received the 
 2012 Best Reviewer Award for his service to Information Systems Research. 
 He received the Meritorious Service awards for his service to Management S
 cience in 2013 and 2015 and he is an associate editor at Management Scienc
 e.\n\nEric's research is motivated by a central observation: activities an
 d processes that have traditionally been conducted in physical environment
 s are shifting to electronic environments. For example\, shopping processe
 s that were once conducted in physical stores are shifting online\, and th
 e process of applying for a loan is shifting from physical bank branches t
 o online lending platforms. Eric's research: a) seeks to explain why some 
 activities and processes are more suitable for migration to electronic env
 ironments than others\, and b) explores the implications of physical-to-el
 ectronic shifts in contexts such as the used car market\, consumer lending
 \, medical records\, and the news media.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.

 arch the solution landscape to learn from both what works and what failed\
 ; take a systems approach to identify the root cause versus the symptoms o
 f the issue.\n\nStudents who aspire to work closely with and learn from a 
 community partner/civic entrepreneur\, those who want to affect change in 
 the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs)\, and those who 
 are wondering how they can make a real\, lasting\, and appropriate differe
 nce in other people’s lives are ideal candidates for I2S.\n\nIn the 2022
  season\, student teams will learn from and work with our Atlanta area com
 munity partners and civic entrepreneurs. A series of hands-on workshops an
 d discussions\, complemented by conversations with experts from the frontl
 ines\, will equip participants with broadly relevant problem discovery too
 ls and skills that they can apply in any field and career. The workshops a
 re offered as part of the MGT4803 Social Impact course and they are open t
 o any student interested.\n\nThe deliverable for I2S is a Stakeholder Map 
 of the social issue student teams explore with their community partner's g
 uidance. The I2S Showcase will take place on April 18 where teams will pre
 sent the outcome of their work to an audience of practitioners\, community
  leaders\, faculty\, and students.\n\nParticipating I2S Teams can apply to
  the Map the System Global Challenge [1] as a part of our collaboration wi

 difference in other people’s lives are ideal candidates for I2S.\n\nIn t

 rea community partners and civic entrepreneurs. A series of hands-on works
 hops and discussions\, complemented by conversations with experts from the
  frontlines\, will equip participants with broadly relevant problem discov
 ery tools and skills that they can apply in any field and career. The work
 shops are offered as part of the MGT4803 Social Impact course and they are
  open to any student interested.\n\nThe deliverable for I2S is a Stakehold

  be a challenge. After all\, it’s natural to desire direction and a sens

  provided to you or to have a clear vision of the future to work towards. 
 However\, uncertainty is a part of life\, especially after the COVID-19 cr

 y\, to help you feel better equipped to navigate gray areas and deal with 
 uncertainty.\n\nRSVP to attend\n\nDinner will be served!\n\nLinks:\n[0]  h

 peaker’s Title: Associate Professor\n\nSpeaker’s Affiliation: ECE Geor
 gia Tech\n\nSeminar Title: So…what exactly do you professors and academi
 cs do anyways?\n\nAbstract of Talk: When I tell people I’m a professor\,
  often the first question is “what do you teach?” For many people teac
 hing is the only picture of what professors do. As students in a top-tier 
 research-heavy institution\, you are aware that there is also the research
  piece of our jobs\, which can be as big or bigger. You may or may not hav
 e a feel for what “research” is like\, but even still you probably are
  missing various other aspects of what professors and academics actually d
 o. This won’t be easy because “research and academia” looks very dif
 ferent from one school\, or one lab\, to the next. But\, I’ll do my best
  to open up and (1) fill in those gaps\, including the many pieces of an a
 cademic job\, (2) go into the decision process I went into that landed me 
 here\, and (3) discuss why I love my job and would not change my career ro
 ute\, but at the same time this job is not for everyone (no job is\, excep
 t maybe Senior Vice President of Ice Cream Tasting).\n\nBiographical Sketc
 h of the Speaker: Morris Cohen received his B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Elec
 trical Engineering from Stanford University in 2003 and 2010\, respectivel
 y\, and served as a research scientist there until August 2013. From Septe
 mber 2012 until August 2013\, Dr. Cohen was appointed as AAAS Science and 
 Technology Policy Fellow at the National Science Foundation.\n\nIn Fall 20
 13\, he joined the faculty in the School of ECE at Georgia Tech\, with pro
 motion and tenure as of Summer 2018. He was selected for the NSF CAREER aw
 ard in 2017 and received the ONR Young Investigator Award in 2015. He is t
 he winner of the 2014 Santimay Basu Prize by the International Union of Ra
 dio Science\, an award given once per three years to an early career scien
 tist. He also won Georgia Tech's Junior Faculty Teaching Excellence Award 
 in 2018. He is an author of more than 90 journal publications and 200 conf
 erence presentations. He serves as President of the Atmospheric and Space 
 Electricity Section of the American Geophysical Union. He enjoys hiking\, 
 skiing\, cooking\, traveling\, building pizza ovens\, and writing biosketc

 nExtras: Free food\nStatus: published\n\nThis is a weekly workshop series 
 for Ideas to Serve participants. This week we explore peer feedback and fi
 nalizing your map.\n\nWe take a comprehensive approach to social innovatio
 n encouraging students to be compassionate listeners\; identify and build 
 on the assets\; research the solution landscape to learn from both what wo
 rks and what failed\; take a systems approach to identify the root cause v
 ersus the symptoms of the issue.\n\nStudents who aspire to work closely wi
 th and learn from a community partner/civic entrepreneur\, those who want 
 to affect change in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSD
 Gs)\, and those who are wondering how they can make a real\, lasting\, and
  appropriate difference in other people’s lives are ideal candidates for
  I2S.\n\nIn the 2022 season\, student teams will learn from and work with 
 our Atlanta area community partners and civic entrepreneurs. A series of h
 ands-on workshops and discussions\, complemented by conversations with exp
 erts from the frontlines\, will equip participants with broadly relevant p
 roblem discovery tools and skills that they can apply in any field and car
 eer. The workshops are offered as part of the MGT4803 Social Impact course
  and they are open to any student interested.\n\nThe deliverable for I2S i
 s a Stakeholder Map of the social issue student teams explore with their c
 ommunity partner's guidance. The I2S Showcase will take place on April 18 
 where teams will present the outcome of their work to an audience of pract
 itioners\, community leaders\, faculty\, and students.\n\nParticipating I2
 S Teams can apply to the Map the System Global Challenge [1] as a part of 
 our collaboration with the Skoll Center for Social Entrepreneurship at the
  Saïd Business School at Oxford. The top team(s) from I2S will represent 
 Georgia Tech at Oxford and compete with teams focused on social impact fro
 m top universities around the world.\n\nLearn more about our community par

  South Florida\n\nSummary\n\nAn organism’s physical environment can dram
 atically affect an organisms’ behavior and morphological design. The Rey
 nolds number represents the ratio between inertial and viscous forces in a
  fluid environment. This study is concerned with the challenges crustaceou
 s plankton face resulting from living in a low- and intermediate-Reynolds 
 number aquatic environment.\n\nIn the first part of this study\, the fresh
 water copepod Hesperodiaptomus shoshone is exposed to a Burgers vortex- a 
 flow feature meant to mimic turbulent eddies found in an organism’s envi
 ronment. Male and female copepods were exposed to four vortex intensity le
 vels plus a negative control in either a horizontal or vertical orientatio
 n of the vortex axis. Trajectory analysis of H. shoshone swimming behavior
  shows that this copepod changes its swimming behavior in response to vort
 ex orientation and not vortex level- a notable difference from marine cope
 pods exposed to the same flow feature. These results may be linked to ecol
 ogical and geographic differences between freshwater and marine copepods.\
 n\nIn the second part of this study\, the pleopod synchrony in the mysid s
 hrimp Americamysis bahia is quantified. Shrimp and krill beat their pleopo
 ds in an adlocomotory sequence\, creating a metachronal wave. Usually\, pl
 eopod pairs on the same abdominal segment beat in tandem with each other\,
  resulting in one 5-paddle stroke. Americamysis bahia ’s pleopods on the
  same abdominal segment beat independently from each other\, resulting in 
 two 5-paddle metachronal cycles that run ipsilaterally along the body\, 18
 0° out of phase with each other. High-speed recordings of A. bahia stroke
  kinematics reveal how this mysid changes its stroke amplitude\, beat freq
 uency\, and inter-appendage phase lag to achieve high speeds. Trends with 
 Strouhal number and advance ratio suggest that the kinematics of metachron
 y in A. bahia are tuned to achieve large normalized swimming speeds.\n\nIn
  the third part of this study\, stroke kinematics in Euphausia pacifica (P
 acific krill) are quantified for the first time. Comparing stroke kinemati
 cs between E. pacifica (1-3cm body length) and the larger E. superba (4-6c
 m body length) shows that these two organisms achieve similar swimming mod
 es through a different set of stroke kinematics. To better understand the 
 relationship between stroke kinematics\, resulting swimming mode\, and len
 gth scale\, these data are used in tandem with previously published stroke
  kinematics of other 5-paddle metachronal swimmers\, including mysid shrim
 p and stomatopods\, to identify broad trends across species and length sca
 le in metachrony. Principle component analysis (PCA) reveals trends in str
 oke kinematics\, Reynolds number\, and swimming mode as well as variation 
 among taxonomic order. Additionally\, uniform phase lag\, i.e. when the ti
 ming between power strokes of all adjacent pleopods is equal\, in 5-paddle
 s systems is achieved at different Reynolds numbers for each swimming mode
 \, which highlights the importance of taking into consideration stroke kin
 ematics\, length scale\, and resulting swimming mode in bio-inspired desig
 n applications.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.edu/node/656891#0\n[1]  h

 nWith rising demand for decarbonization and increased focus on sustainabil
 ity\, energy-efficient precise separations have become critical in industr
 ial production and municipal needs. In particular\, separating components 
 from water with high selectivity is conducive to pollutant removal\, water
  quality monitoring\, and resource recovery. This dissertation focuses on 
 the design and application of porous superabsorbent polymer (PSAP) beads f
 or fast\, effective\, and low-cost three-dimensional (3D) water filtration
 . The PSAP beads with high water absorbency and controllable pore structur
 e can achieve selective absorption of target species in water samples with
 out any external driving forces. This innovative material would realize a 
 simple and flexible separation technology that can be used to concentrate 
 bioproducts or stabilize sensitive analytical targets. The rationally desi
 gned PSAP beads have been applied to harvest microalgae\, which can be use
 d to produce renewable biofuels and high-value bioproducts. The optimal po
 re structure of the beads can achieve fast water uptake without sacrificin
 g microalgae harvesting efficiency. This technique potentially provides an
  efficient and feasible alternative for microalgae harvesting and facilita
 tes microalgal product manufacture for environmental applications in the f
 ood-energy-water nexus. In addition\, the PSAP beads have been applied to 
 extract and preserve virus targets in water samples while excluding undesi

 ration Enabled by Porous Superabsorbent Polymer Beads for Environmental Ap
 plications\n\nby\n\nWensi Chen\nAdvisor(s): Dr. Xing Xie\nCommittee Member
 s: Dr. Kostas Konstantinidis (CEE)\, Dr. Yongsheng Chen (CEE)\, Dr. Sotira
  Yiacoumi (CEE)\, Dr. Ryan Lively (ChBE)\n\nWith rising demand for decarbo
 nization and increased focus on sustainability\, energy-efficient precise 
 separations have become critical in industrial production and municipal ne
 eds. In particular\, separating components from water with high selectivit
 y is conducive to pollutant removal\, water quality monitoring\, and resou
 rce recovery. This dissertation focuses on the design and application of p
 orous superabsorbent polymer (PSAP) beads for fast\, effective\, and low-c
 ost three-dimensional (3D) water filtration. The PSAP beads with high wate
 r absorbency and controllable pore structure can achieve selective absorpt
 ion of target species in water samples without any external driving forces
 . This innovative material would realize a simple and flexible separation 
 technology that can be used to concentrate bioproducts or stabilize sensit
 ive analytical targets. The rationally designed PSAP beads have been appli
 ed to harvest microalgae\, which can be used to produce renewable biofuels
  and high-value bioproducts. The optimal pore structure of the beads can a
 chieve fast water uptake without sacrificing microalgae harvesting efficie
 ncy. This technique potentially provides an efficient and feasible alterna
 tive for microalgae harvesting and facilitates microalgal product manufact
 ure for environmental applications in the food-energy-water nexus. In addi
 tion\, the PSAP beads have been applied to extract and preserve virus targ
 ets in water samples while excluding undesired components such as bacteria
 l cells. The polymer scaffold is further modified to enhance immobilizatio
 n and stabilization effects for the captured virus targets. Thus\, the enh
 anced PSAP beads can eliminate the temperature regulations for virus sampl
 e storage\, which could be compatible with advanced epidemiology tools to 
 implement large-scale viral pathogen surveillance networks. Given the vers
 atile applicability of the PSAP beads for biofluid treatment\, they can al
 so be used for biomarker encapsulation and biofluid specimen stabilization
 \, which enables off-site diagnostic testing and disease control in medica
 lly underserved areas. The results presented in this dissertation highligh
 t a self-driven 3D filtration platform based on the PSAP materials and bro
 aden the prospects of its applications in various fields.\n\nLinks:\n[0]

 n encouraging students to be compassionate listeners\; identify and build 
 on the assets\; research the solution landscape to learn from both what wo
 rks and what failed\; take a systems approach to identify the root cause v
 ersus the symptoms of the issue.\n\nStudents who aspire to work closely wi
 th and learn from a community partner/civic entrepreneur\, those who want 
 to affect change in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSD
 Gs)\, and those who are wondering how they can make a real\, lasting\, and
  appropriate difference in other people’s lives are ideal candidates for
  I2S.\n\nIn the 2022 season\, student teams will learn from and work with 
 our Atlanta area community partners and civic entrepreneurs. A series of h
 ands-on workshops and discussions\, complemented by conversations with exp
 erts from the frontlines\, will equip participants with broadly relevant p
 roblem discovery tools and skills that they can apply in any field and car
 eer. The workshops are offered as part of the MGT4803 Social Impact course
  and they are open to any student interested.\n\nThe deliverable for I2S i

 ommunity partner's guidance. The I2S Showcase will take place on April 18 
 where teams will present the outcome of their work to an audience of pract

 ding AI safety as an academic field.\n\nAbstract: AI systems are rapidly i
 ncreasing in size\, are acquiring new capabilities\, and are increasingly 
 deployed in high-stakes settings. As with other powerful technologies\, sa
 fety for AI should be a leading research priority. In response to emerging
  safety challenges in AI\, such as those introduced by recent large-scale 
 models\, I provide a pragmatic new roadmap for AI safety. I'll discuss how
  researchers can shape the process that will lead to strong AI systems and
  steer that process in a safer direction.\n\nFor an informal introduction

 \nThe OUE Equity Collective [1] invites all students\, faculty\, and staff
  to hear from Sudanese Civil War refugee\, Majok Marier\, on April 22 from
  1-2 p.m. Majok\, one of the thousands of children known as the "Lost Boys
  and Girls of Sudan\," will talk about his experiences in 1983 escaping th
 e second Sudanese Civil War and his non-profit organization\, Wells for Ho
 pe for South Sudan. Wells for Hope has worked to bring water wells to vill
 ages near Rumbek\, South Sudan - his home - over the past several years. R
 egister here. [2]\n\nEvent Details:\n\nApril 22\, 2022\, 1-2p.m.\n\nIn-per

 meeting ID: 997 3137 7382\nZoom meeting passcode: 866110\n\nMore about Maj
 ok:\n\nIn 1983\, the Second Sudanese Civil war (1983-2005) broke out. Majo
 k Marier was seven when he fled soldiers attacking his village. Along with
  thousands of other children\, who would become known as the Lost Boys and
  Girls of Sudan\, Majok trekked across Sudan to Ethiopia\, arriving at Pin
 yudo Refugee Camp in 1998.\n\nIn 1991\, the Ethiopian government was overt
 hrown\, and Sudanese refugees had to flee again. Majok eventually arrived 
 at the Kakuma Refugee Camp in Kenya in 1992. There for nine years\, Majok 
 learned English and became a Catholic. In 2001\, he was able to come to th
 e United States and settled in Clarkston\, GA along with many others who h
 ad survived years of hardship and were still living in Kakuma. Majok event
 ually found work as a plumber’s assistant.\n\nSouth Sudan gained indepen
 dence in 2011\, and when his sister died in childbirth back home\, Majok d
 ecided to do something to create better access to medical care for South S
 udanese villages. Realizing that the first step to better medical care was
  clean water\, Majok\, his fellow Lost Boys\, and many concerned friends c
 reated a non-profit organization\, Wells for Hope for South Sudan [4]\, to
  bring water wells to villages near Rumbek\, South Sudan. There\, women an
 d children walk 8-12 miles roundtrip every day to bring back clean water f
 or their families. Majok now has a wife and children of his own in Rumbek 
 and has been working to build health clinics in addition to the six wells 
 that have been built since 2015. Millions of people across Africa die each
  year from diseases caused by unsafe water supplies.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http:

  students to be compassionate listeners\; identify and build on the assets
 \; research the solution landscape to learn from both what works and what 
 failed\; take a systems approach to identify the root cause versus the sym
 ptoms of the issue.\n\nStudents who aspire to work closely with and learn 
 from a community partner/civic entrepreneur\, those who want to affect cha
 nge in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs)\, and tho
 se who are wondering how they can make a real\, lasting\, and appropriate 
 difference in other people’s lives are ideal candidates for I2S.\n\nIn t
 he 2022 season\, student teams will learn from and work with our Atlanta a
 rea community partners and civic entrepreneurs. A series of hands-on works
 hops and discussions\, complemented by conversations with experts from the
  frontlines\, will equip participants with broadly relevant problem discov
 ery tools and skills that they can apply in any field and career. The work
 shops are offered as part of the MGT4803 Social Impact course and they are
  open to any student interested.\n\nThe deliverable for I2S is a Stakehold
 er Map of the social issue student teams explore with their community part
 ner's guidance. The I2S Showcase will take place on April 18 where teams w
 ill present the outcome of their work to an audience of practitioners\, co
