 \n\nThis actually happened to Dr. Jennifer Glass\, an Associate Professor 
 in the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences\, when she incorporated a 
 Wikipedia assignment into her teaching. By completing a semester-long Wiki
 pedia editing project on scientific writing on notable topics in environme

 cs. They also developed skills to analyze digital sources of information f
 or accuracy and to collaboratively produce reliable information for variou
 s public audiences. While some students found that the assignment could be
  more tasking and time consuming than they expected\, others remarked how 
 they enjoyed this authentic learning activity\, and expressed their pride 
 in contributing to something larger than themselves.\n\nPlease join your c
 olleagues in this Teaching with Technology Spotlight session to learn how 
 Dr. Glass used Wikipedia as a teaching tool to help her students learn and

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Public\
 , Undergraduate students\nStatus: published\n\nAvani Gupta\n(Advisor: Prof
 . Lakshmi N. Sankar)\n\nwill propose a doctoral thesis entitled\,\n\nAppli
 cation of an Extended Messinger Model to Ice Accretion on Complex Geometri
 es\n\nOn\n\nFriday\, February 7 at 10:00 a.m.\nMontgomery Knight Building 
 317\n\nAbstract\nIce accretion can significantly degrade the performance a
 nd the stability of an airborne vehicle. Therefore\, it is important to mo
 del this phenomenon accurately. While researchers have conducted extensive
  ice accretion studies in the past on airplane wings and helicopter blades
 \, very few of these studies are for more complex geometries such as fusel
 ages. This work proposes a methodology that extends an existing in-house E
 xtended Messinger ice accretion solver to complex geometries on unstructur
 ed grids\, with a marching process along surface streamlines to handle thr
 ee-dimensional flow effects.\n\nThe work completed to date includes sensit
 ivity studies for ice accretion and shedding on shortened Schweizer 269 ma
 in rotor blades and two-dimensional steady and oscillating airfoil ice acc
 retion cases\, on structured grids. Towards the goal of developing unstruc
 tured grid based methodologies\, several different cases with varying leve
 ls of complexity have been completed. These include a commercial transport
  airfoil\, a three-dimensional MS(1)-317 swept wing at different angles of
  attack\, and the Robin fuselage.\n\nUnstructured grid based analyses usin
 g commercial solvers such as STAR-CCM+ and ANSYS Fluent have been used to 
 date for the flow field and water droplet dispersed phase computations. Th
 e ice accretion is carried out using an in-house analysis called GT-ICE. T
 he predictions by GT-ICE have compared to available experimental data\, an
 d to predictions by LEWICE\, an industry standard solver developed at the 
 NASA Glenn Research Center.\n\nThe proposed work includes the development 
 of an unstructured grid based Eulerian droplet trajectory and collection e
 fficiency methodology using public domain modules within OpenFOAM\, couple
 d to a surface streamline visualization and data extraction process using 
 the public domain solver ParaView. GT-ICE will be employed for ice accreti
 on computations. The new methodology is capable of handling 2D and 3D\, st
 ructured and unstructured\, steady and unsteady flow analyses.\n\nCommitte

 \nDirect Write Processing of 3D Composite Nanostructures and 2D Electronic
  Materials using Focused Beams of Molecules and Electrons\nProf. Andrei Fe
 dorov - School of Mechanical Engineering\, Georgia Tech\nAbstract: Focused
  Electron Beam Induced Processing (FEBIP) is a powerful method for atom-by
 -atom fabrication of topologically complex nanostructures from a variety o
 f materials. It has potential to provide a comprehensive processing enviro
 nment for emerging electronic and quantum devices based on 2D materials. W
 e are developing a family of multi-mode energized micro/nano-jet technique
 s for local precursor delivery to resolve the FEBID challenges and to expa
 nd the range of useful precursors from gas to liquid phase for broader FEB
 IP applications. Energized micro/nano-jets of thermally or electro-kinetic
 ally energized precursors in both gas and liquid phase provide unique capa
 bilities for localized delivery of precursor molecules to the substrate\, 
 thus establishing locally controlled deposition/etching site for FEBIP. Un
 derstanding of fascinating and interacting chemistry and physics on the mo
 st fundamental level will be discussed as a route to develop new FEBIP mod
 es and applications to emerging electronic and quantum devices based on 2D
  materials.\n\nBio: Andrei G. Fedorov is Rae S. and Frank H. Chaired Profe
 ssor in the School of Mechanical Engineering and the Petit Institute for B
 ioengineering and Biosciences at Georgia Tech. His current research focuse
 s on electron-beam-mediated nanomanufacturing\, MEMS-enabled bioanalytical
  instrumentation\, thermal management of high performance electronics\, an
 d power generation with synergetic CO2 capture. Fedorov has authored/co-au
 thored over 200 archival articles in premier technical journals. His resea
 rch has led to development of new technologies for various applications\, 
 resulting in over 40 issued US patents and pending patent applications. Fo
 r his inventions of biomedical devices\, the World Technology Network (WTN
 )\, in cooperation with AAAS Science Magazine\, CNN\, and leading technolo
 gy companies\, selected Fedorov as a WTN Associate and one of the twenty-f
 ive “most innovative people and organizations in the science and technol
 ogy world” nominated for the 2005 World Technology Award in Health and M
 edicine. He was recognized with the US National Aeronautics and Space Admi
 nistration (NASA) Invention & Contribution Board Award for development of 
 catalytic reactor technologies\, as well as multiple inventor recognition 
 awards from the Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC) and Microelectron

 , Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\nStatus: draft\n\nAbstract:\n\
 nGeorgia Tech has been at the forefront of sustainability since its incept
 ion in the 1880's. This is evidenced by the fact that the original brick b
 uildings on campus were made from indigenous Georgia red clay\, and Grant 
 Field was the home to football\, baseball and track. Fast forward to 2019 
 where we have just built the Kendeda Building for Innovative Sustainable D
 esign\, slated to be one of the most sustainable buildings in the southeas
 t\, on the path to meet the stringent requirements of the Living Building 
 Challenge. Come learn about the evolution of Georgia Tech's 400-acre ecosy
 stem and our commitment to sustainable campus development.\n\nSpeaker Bio:
 \n\nHoward Wertheimer is a Fellow in the American Institute of Architects 
 and a LEED Accredited Professional. From 2006-2019\, Howard served as the 
 AVP for Capital Planning & Space Management and Institute Architect at the
  Georgia Institute of Technology where he had strategic oversight of the C
 ampus Master Plan\, Landscape Master Plan\, Historic Preservation Plan\, c
 ampus-wide sustainability initiatives\, curation of public art\, and most 
 things visually exposed. He was responsible for the aesthetics and visual 
 vocabulary of the campus\, which currently includes over 16M square feet o
 f space in 200 buildings on 400 acres in Atlanta\, Georgia.\n\nWhile at Ge
 orgia Tech\, Howard lead the development of the Kendeda Building for Susta
 inable Design and has delivered numerous papers across the country on Geor
 gia Tech’s Living Building journey\, anticipated to be one the most envi
 ronmentally advanced education and research buildings on a university camp
 us in the Southeast.\n\nHoward is currently the Executive Vice President a
 nd Chief Operating Officer at the Piedmont Park Conservancy\, a non-profit
  overseeing the stewardship\, operations\, financial procedures\, programs
  and overall performance to cultivate substantial and sustainable growth o
 f Atlanta’s iconic Piedmont Park\, which is the heart and soul of the ci
 ty.\n\nSchedule of Brown Bag Speakers Spring 2020 [1]\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http

 Pless is a highly regarded specialty structural engineering firm founded i
 n 1964 in Atlanta. Over the past 55 years\, the firm has developed a reput

 en to practice\, rather than evolving into a traditional large generalist 
 structural engineering firm. As a result of this focus\, the firm has deve
 loped specialized skills and attracted highly experienced engineers. This 
 has resulted in being called upon to execute more complex structural engin
 eering projects.\n\nThe firm has offices in multiple states in the US\, bu
 t provides specialty services across the country and internationally. Benn

 ly\nGraduating global citizens is one of Georgia Tech’s strategic goals\
 , yet many students don’t have the opportunity to study abroad. What are
  we doing at home to help students engage in global challenges and develop
  intercultural communication skills? In this workshop\, we invite particip
 ants to consider how integrating the United Nations Sustainable Developmen
 t Goals (SDGs) into their courses will help foster global citizenship no m
 atter where students are learning. The UN SDGs [1] are a set of 17 broad a
 nd interconnected goals that address the global challenges we face. We arg
 ue that the SDGs can be incorporated into any course regardless of discipl
 ine. Faculty members from diverse programs at Georgia Tech will share exam
 ples of how they have incorporated the SDGs into their courses. Workshop p
 articipants will have the opportunity to articulate their vision for how t
 he SDGs may work in their own course and identify (and propose) resources 
 that can help support them in realizing it.\n\nWorkshop facilitators:\n\n-

 nipulation that creates a knitted stitch – pulling a loop of yarn throug
 h another loop. However\, there exist hundreds of books with thousands of 
 patterns of stitches with seemingly unbounded complexity.\n\nThe topology 
 of knitted stitches has a profound impact on the geometry and elasticity o
 f the resulting fabric. This puts a new spin on additive manufacturing –
  not only can stitch pattern control the local and global geometry of a te
 xtile\, but the creation process encodes mechanical properties within the 
 material itself. Unlike standard additive manufacturing techniques\, the i
 nnate properties of the yarn and the stitch microstructure has a direct ef
 fect on the global geometric and mechanical outcome of knitted fabrics.\n\
 nSpeaker Bio:\n\nElisabetta Matsumoto is an assistant professor in the Sch
 ool of Physics at Georgia Institute of Technology. Her physics research ce
 nters around the relationship between geometry and material properties in 
 soft systems\, including liquid crystals\, 3D printing and textiles. She i
 s also interested in using sewing\, 3D printing and virtual reality in mat
 hematical art and education. She is the recipient of an NSF CAREER award. 
 She studied physics at the University of Pennsylvania\, earning her BA and
  MS in 2007 and her PhD in 2011. She has been knitting and crochet since s
 he was about 12 and has been sewing for longer than she can remember.\n\nS

 ure Series on Public Policy Presents: Prof. Richard Barke Associate Profes
 sor in the School of Public Policy FOOD & BEVERAGES PROVIDED ● Why don
 ’t policymakers take expert scientific advise more seriously?\n● How d
 oes S&T expertise get into the policy process?\n● Can a good scientist o
 r engineer be a good policymaker?\n● What strategies and tactics can Tec
 h students and alumni use to have more impact?\n\nAfter graduating from Ge
 orgia Tech (Physics)\, Professor Barke earned a Ph.D. in Political Science
  from the University of Rochester. He has advised agencies in the U.S. and
  abroad\, the U.S. Congress\, and companies on how to incorporate expert s
 cientific advice into public policy. In this lecture\, he shares what he h
 as learned over the years about the effectiveness of scientists in politic
 al arenas. Examples include cases from FDA\, EPA\, FCC\, NASA\, and the U.
 S. Congress. Professor Barke’s research focuses on the roles of politics
  within science and of science within politics\, and the regulation of ris
 k (particularly the FDA). Dr. Barke has written about topics such as the p
 olitical behavior of scientific disciplines\, the politics of science budg
 eting in Congress\, and how scientists translate scientific findings into 
 policy recommendations. Recent works involve the decision making processes
  by which science and ethics are reconciled in the regulation of research\
 , particularly research involving human subjects and in nanotechnology. Cu
 rrently he is writing a book about political\, cognitive\, and economic ob
 stacles to long-term policy making.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.edu/n

 nThere is increasing excitement about reinforcement learning--a subarea of
  machine learning for enabling an agent to learn to make good decisions. Y
 et numerous questions and challenges remain for reinforcement learning to 
 help support progress in applications that involve interacting with people
 \, like education\, consumer marketing and healthcare. I will discuss our 
 work on some of the technical challenges that arise in this pursuit\, incl
 uding sample efficiency\, counterfactual reasoning\, robustness\, and appl
 ications to health and education.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\nEmma Brunskill is an 
 assistant professor in the Computer Science Department at Stanford Univers
 ity where she leads the AI for Human Impact group. Her work focuses on rei
 nforcement learning in high stakes scenarios--how can an agent learn from 
 experience to make good decisions when experience is costly or risky\, suc
 h as in educational software\, healthcare decision making\, or people-faci
 ng applications. She was previously a professor at Carnegie Mellon Univers
 ity. She is the recipient of multiple early faculty career awards (Nationa
 l Science Foundation\, Office of Naval Research\, Microsoft Research) and 
 her group has received several best research paper nominations (CHI\, EDMx
 3) and awards (UAI\, RLDM).\n\nSchedule of Brown Bag Speakers Spring 2020

 , Undergraduate students\nStatus: published\n\nmy PhD thesis titled "Impor
 tance of Manganese oxides in carbon remineralization in river-dominated co
 ntinental margins and the biogeochemical cycling of arsenic" on February 2
 7th at 1 pm in Ford EST L1114. My committee members include Dr. Martial Ta
 illefert (advisor\, GT EAS)\, Dr. Yuanzhi Tang (GT\, EAS) Dr. Thomas DiChr
 istina (GT\, BIO)\, Dr. Frank Stewart (Montana State University)\, Dr. Geo
 rge Luther (Univ. of Delaware)\, and Dr. Christophe Rabouille (Univ d'Sacl
 ay\, CEA\, LSCE\, France). My abstract is included below.\n\nBest regards\
 ,\n\nShannon Owings\n\nManganese oxides (MnO2) are ubiquitous in the envir
 onment and play an important role in the transformation and transport of c
 ontaminants in the environment in addition to play a major role in the bio
 geochemical cycling of carbon. This study investigated both aspects of the
 se roles using a combination of laboratory experiments and field work. Fir
 st\, the kinetics of oxidation of the more toxic arsenic form\, arsenite (
 As(III))\, to the less mobile form\, arsenate (As(V))\, by MnO2 was determ
 ined and compared to literature data to investigate the mechanism of the r
 eaction. Subsequently\, the effect of low As(V) concentrations on the anae
 robic microbial respiration of MnO2 and iron oxides\, Fe(OH)3\, were inves
 tigated to shed light into the mechanism of As(V) toxicity in aquatic envi
 ronments. At low As(V) concentrations\, microbial reduction rates were inc
 reased compared to arsenic-free treatments suggesting As(V) at low concent
 rations stimulates metal reduction (MnO2\, Fe(OH)3) in sediments as a resu
 lt of a catalytic cycle in which arsenic is constantly reduced via microbi
 al detoxification and re-oxidized by MnO2. The cumulative findings from th
 is study suggest that arsenic is not simply immobilized in sediments and t
 hat a suite of complex abiotic and microbial processes including adsorptio
 n\, intracellular transport\, and redox reactions may affect the transport
  of arsenic in the environment\, and ultimately the quality of drinking wa
 ter resources.\n\nIn parallel to laboratory experiments\, manganese cyclin
 g\, and the dominant redox pathways involved in carbon remineralization pr
 ocesses were characterized in marine sediments across the Louisiana shelf 
 and slope that are exposed to mineral and terrestrial organic inputs from 
 the Mississippi River. Although sulfate reduction dominates on the contine
 ntal shelf\, denitrification and microbial manganese reduction appear equa
 lly significant anaerobic respiration processes along the continental slop
 e the closest to the Mississippi River. This study emphasizes how the diff
 erential oxidation kinetics of Mn2+ (slow) and Fe2+ (fast) as well as sedi
 ment transport processes influence the main pathways of carbon degradation
  in these regions. Overall this thesis emphasizes the importance of charac
 terizing the fundamental molecular processes of complex systems to better 
 understand large scale global biogeochemical cycles.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http:

 ity\n\nAbstract:\n\n-----------\n\nHumans have an inherent understanding o
 f the shape of their environment and the objects contained in it. Given a 
 description of a room\, a person can understand a reasonable approximation
  of the space and the objects. However\, our current methods lack this typ
 e of contextual understanding (i.e. a chair is shaped a particular way and
  indicates you can sit on it). This work is motivated by the idea that the
 re is an inherent relationship between 3D information such as shape and sc
 ene understanding/object classification. Objects such as tables\, chairs\,
  and cups have a specific shape and our models should leverage and learn t
 hat information. Depth and surface normals have frequently been used as ad
 ditional signals in semantic labeling work\; however\, there is still limi
 ted understanding on using and learning shape and labels jointly. Our work
  examines using 3D cues for unsupervised and supervised approaches for seg
 mentation and semantic labeling. We show how to use 3D information for rob
 ust unsupervised segmentation\, supervised semantic labeling using segment
 ation\, and unsupervised object categorization. We explore this relationsh
 ip further by showing how shape helps deep neural networks semantically la
 bel indoor environments. We explore how joint estimation of shape and labe
 ls improves both results when learned together and how they can both be do
 ne with little added model capacity.\n\nThis defense aims to demonstrate h
 ow 3D cues may be used to improve semantic labeling and object classificat
 ion. Specifically\, we will consider depth\, surface normals\, object clas
 sification\, and pixel-wise semantic labeling in this work. The works outl
 ined aim to validate the following thesis statement: Shape is used as an a
 dditional context that improves segmentation\, unsupervised clustering\, o
 bject classification\, and semantic labeling with little computational ove
 rhead.\n\nThe presented work will show:\n\nCombining shape and object labe
 ls improves results (1) requires few extra parameters to do so\, (2) impro
 ves with surface normals more than with depth\, and (3) improves accuracy 
 for each task. We describe various methods to combine shape and object cla
 ssification and then discuss our extensions of the proposed work which foc
 us on surface normal prediction and semantic labeling specifically.\n\nLin

 \nOptimization over the Diffeomorphism Group Using Riemannian BFGS with Ap
 plication\nAbstract. The set of diffeomorphisms of the unit interval\, or 
 “warping functions\,” plays an important role in many in functional da
 ta analysis applications. Most prominently\, the problem of registering\, 
 or aligning\, pairs of functions depends on solving for an element of the 
 diffeomorphism group that\, when applied to one function\, optimally align
 s it to the other. The registration problem is posed as the unconstrained 
 minimization of a cost function over the infinite dimensional diffeomorphi
 sm function space. We make use of its well-known Riemannian geometry – t
 he positive orthant of the unit Hilbert sphere under the L2 metric – to 
 implement an efficient\, limited memory Riemannian BFGS optimization schem
 e. We compare performance and results to the benchmark algorithm\, Dynamic
  Programming\, on several functional datasets. Additionally\, we apply our
  methodology to the problem of non-parametric density estimation and compa
 re to the benchmark performance of MATLAB’s built-in kernel density esti
 mator ‘ksdensity’.\n\nBiography.\n\nDarshan Bryner received his B.S. d
 egree in Applied Mathematics in 2007 and his M.S. degree in Mathematics in
  2008\, both from Georgia Institute of Technology. In 2008\, he joined the
  Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) as a researc
 h scientist. While employed at NSWC PCD\, in 2010 he began work on his Ph.
 D. degree in Statistics at Florida State University and graduated in 2013.
  Under the co-advisement of Dr. Anuj Srivastava and Dr. Eric Klassen\, his
  thesis was on developing affine invariant\, elastic shape models to use a
 s prior distributions in a Bayesian active contour method for sonar image 
 segmentation. Dr. Bryner continues his research at NSWC PCD in a variety o
 f areas including Riemannian geometry and manifold optimization\, Bayesian
  inference in spatial statistics\, and bioinformatics. Since 2017\, Dr. Br
 yner has served as the head of the Advanced Signal Processing and Automati
 c Target Recognition Branch (Code X23) within the Science and Technology D
 epartment at NSWC PCD.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.edu/node/632525#0\

 n\nPlease register [1] to attend this upcoming teaching with technology wo
 rkshop!\n\nEvery semester we engage Georgia Tech students in a variety of 
 assessment experiences that are intended to determine what they have learn
 ed. For a number of these students\, however\, our assessments fall short 
 of their goal. Whether it’s due to language differences or to the fact t
 hat their brains are wired differently\, many students don’t get a chanc
 e to fully demonstrate what they know—and we don’t get a chance to fin
 d out the impact of our teaching.\n\nHow common is this experience? It may
  surprise you to learn that neurodivergent-related accommodations are now 
 the most frequent accommodation type at Georgia Tech. Regardless of whethe
 r you’re teaching to the highly diverse student population of an online 
 at-scale course or you’re teaching a small class of residential students
 \, you are likely to encounter students who require more diversity in asse
 ssment if you want to truly evaluate their learning experience.\n\nAlthoug
 h the thought of providing multiple types of assessments can be overwhelmi
 ng\, technology can be a great help. In this workshop\, we will explore a 
 variety of technologies such as Gradescope and Kaltura that will make it e
 asier for you to create\, collect\, and provide feedback on assessments th
 at allow for multiple means of action and expression. We will discuss how 
 the principles of Universal Design for Learning (UDL) can aid us in creati
 ng assessments that allow every student to demonstrate their learning. And
  we will hear from hear from Anne Jannarone\, Assistant Dean and Director 
 of the Office of Disability Services\, about neurodivergent students at Ge
 orgia Tech and what resources are available to you.\n\nJoin us and learn f
 irst-hand about multiple means of assessment and the technologies that mak
 e this process possible. Bring your laptop to explore examples during hand
 s-on activities\, or simply follow along with someone at your table. Wheth
 er you’re teaching large diverse populations in the online OMS program o
 r an array of students in a face-to-face course on campus\, there are ways
  that both you and your students can benefit from multiple means of assess
 ment. We look forward to seeing you at the workshop!\n\nLunch will be prov
 ided. Please register [1] [2] to join us!\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech

  Seminar\, Dr. Andrew Dickerson\, University of Central Florida\nNatural s
 ystems often inspire new methods by which to control fluids\, or conversel
 y use fluids to control systems. Three fluid mechanic systems that might c
 ome to mind include: the jetting of microdroplets when peeling an orange\,
  the droplet ejection off of a mosquito wing\, and the splash suppression 
 provided by floating toilet paper during defecation. These phenomena at th
 e interface of biology and fluid mechanics can provide engineers with usef
 ul\, inspired information for future designs. Here we study the explosive 
 dispersal of oil emitted from ‘cracked’ glands in the peels of citrus 
 fruit. The jetting oil undergoes an extreme acceleration to reach velociti
 es in excess of 10 m/s. On a slightly larger scale\, the method mosquitoes
  use to ‘buzz’ their wings free of deposited water drops prompts a loo
 k into how flexible surfaces may be vibrated to self-dry. We find drop eje
 ction is dependent on drop and wing properties\, and wing motion in this h
 ighly-coupled system. On yet a larger scale\, the dynamics of the entry of
  solids into liquid baths\, such as the ‘plop’ of restroom use\, is he
 avily influenced by free surface conditions\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gate

 ay\n\nRobotic systems have been very successful in performing tasks where 
 the inputs are well defined and known in advance. Automotive and electroni
 c manufacturing are the classic success stories where robotic systems have
  demonstrated incredible value for the industry. In unstructured manufactu
 ring\, the inputs of the system can vary significantly\, but the outputs o
 f the system are defined. Food and agriculture production are examples of 
 this type of unstructured manufacturing problem\, but traditional manufact
 uring is also moving in this direction as robotics move beyond welding and
  painting. This presentation will give examples of systems that integrate 
 advanced perception and control technologies into robotic systems to perfo
 rm complex tasks like cutting\, grasping\, and manipulation of objects in 
 an unstructured environment.\n\nRegister Online for upcoming SCL IRC semin

SUMMARY:GVU Center Brown Bag: David Reitter "Modeling Language in its Visu
 al Context"

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Public\
 , Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\nStatus: published\n\nAbstract
 :\n\nWords are always spoken and understood in context. Linguists\, psycho
 logists and computer scientists have recognized this when they defined wor
 d meaning using their aggregate linguistic contexts across large samples. 
 Early examples include Latent Semantic Indexing (Landauer & Dumais 1997)\,
  while recently\, some computational models have become vastly successful 
 in NLP\, such as Word2Vec (Mikolov et al\, 2013) or BERT (Devlin et al.\, 
 2018).\n\nHowever\, when young children learn to speak\, they refer to a m
 uch richer context than language alone. Their parents expose them to a ric
 h visual world\, and that is also a common context for adult language use.
  In this talk\, I argue that modern models for commonsense reasoning and n
 atural language processing should therefore learn from visual and linguist
 ic data.\n\nI will present two examples of multimodal neural models that c
 an bring together visual and linguistic context. One is a language model t
 hat predicts next words better when trained on image embeddings in additio
 n to their captions (Ororbia et al.\, ACL 2019). The other is a BERT-based
  model that set a new state-of-the-art in visual commonsense reasoning\, c
 hoosing answers to questions about movie stills and also giving a reason f
 or these answers (Alberti et al.\, EMNLP 2019). It is pre-trained on a WWW
  corpus of images and ALT tags (texts added for accessibility purposes) be
 fore learning to answer questions about the movie screenshots.\n\nSpeaker 
 Bio:\n\nDavid Reitter is a senior research scientist at Google Research\, 
 New York City\, where he works on modeling conversational and multimodal i
 nteraction using very large-scale data. Until recently\, he was an associa
 te professor of information sciences at Penn State. There\, his research g
 roup carried out NSF-funded research on computational models of human cogn
 ition. David did his postdoc in psychology at Carnegie Mellon University a
 nd holds a PhD in informatics from the University of Edinburgh (2008).\n\n

 ram\, is offering Implicit Bias Workshops for faculty this spring. All fac
 ulty who serve on reappointment\, promotion\, and/or tenure committees and
  faculty search committees are required to participate in an Implicit Bias
  Workshop pursuant to Provost Bras’ memo in October 2016 to academic lea
 ders. However\, all instructional and research faculty are welcomed to att
 end as space permits.\n\nThe goals of these workshops are to increase awar
 eness of the impact of implicit bias and facilitate equitable decision-mak
 ing across myriad processes related to faculty evaluations. As a participa
 nt in the workshop\, you will learn the following:\n\n• An introduction 
 to the concept of implicit bias and how these unconscious\, automatic ment
 al processes may impact behaviors such as evaluating candidates during fac
 ulty search and/or RPT processes.\n\n• Empirical research on vitaes\, le
 tters of recommendations\, and teaching evaluations to illustrate the impa
 ct of implicit bias on decisions.\n\n• Effective practices and strategie
 s for faculty search and RPT committees.\n\nThese workshops will be facili
 tated by Paul Benkeser\, senior associate chair and professor\, Wallace H.
  Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering\; Harris Dimitropoulos\, ass
 ociate professor\, School of Architecture\; Robert Kirkman\, associate pro
 fessor\, School of Public Policy\; Mark Mitchell\, associate director\, Ge
 orgia Tech Research Institute\; and/or Michelle Rinehart\, associate dean

SUMMARY:Save the Date: Diversity\, Inclusion + Social Good in Urban Analyt

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Postdoc
 \, Public\, Undergraduate students\nStatus: published\n\nThis event is gen
 erously sponsored by the Georgia Tech College of Design and the Center for
  Computing and Societies.\n\nBackground\nUrban Analytics (UA) and Smart Ci
 ties (SC) research and degree programs are becoming more common in the U.S
 . and globally. UA and SC research has helped developed powerful technique
 s for spatial data creation\, capture and analysis and has drawn talented 
 individuals to this research.\n\nYet\, these programs and research agendas
  often operate without an explicit ‘plan’ for how technology and data 
 analysis will tackle real world issues. Because these fields are founded w
 ith technocratic and engineering problem-solving ideals (values inherent t
 o analytics and ‘smart’ endeavors)\, research questions and execution 
 in this field may be need re-definition and intervention if they are to he
 lp cities reach the most vulnerable citizens and improve daily life. Resea
 rch and thought leadership in UA and SC should include the voices and inpu
 t of the typical urbanite and those most in need. This field also should d
 eeply consider how different perspectives on race\, ethnicity\, gender\, s
 exual-orientation\, disability and poverty status (and more) may add cruci
 al variables to the study of urban analytics.\n\nResearch Contribution\nWe
  will be generating solutions for how our research and teaching can includ
 e a more diverse body of tacit knowledge from the urban community and how 
 can we solve real-life problems with data analytics. We will be developing
  strategies and recommending formal research frameworks (mixed-method\, mu
 lti-scale\, validating-by-interview\, etc.) to guide UA and SC research to
 wards championing citizen voices and helping people. Our goal is to empowe
 r UA students and researchers to shape urban research questions\, methodol
 ogies and implementation in way that positively impacts the city and its p
 eople.\n\nWe will have meaningful conversations and develop a guiding agen
 da that can serve as an ‘intervention’ that is needed as UA and SC fie
 lds mature. Without this discussion\, these fields may not adopt the kinds
  of sensitivities towards diversity\, inclusion and the human experience\,
  that it needs to best serve the people. The agenda will help put forth:\n
 \n- A plan to put crucial information into the hands of the city’s most 
 vulnerable populations.\n- Methods for using technology to collect data on
  spatial behaviors in a safe\, privacy-securing way\, and using the inform
 ation to optimize locations of services and facilities.\n- Designs for tec
 h education for disadvantaged and underrepresented populations at multiple
  levels.\n- Methods to identify which small changes can have the biggest i
 mpact.\n- How to listen to and learn from citizens who need help and have 
 first-hand perspectives (i.e. tacit knowledge) on the urban ecosystem.\n- 
 Open ended discussion on how to connect urban analytics to common-sense ur
 ban problems.\n\nActivities\nOur panel sessions will contain five speakers
  each\, and will include a mixture of visuals and oral presentations.\n\nB
 reakout sessions will divide our participants into 3 groups. The topics wi
 ll be formed by our set of distinguished breakout leaders and can be adjus
 ted to reflect the pressing needs of the day.\n\nPanelists\, breakout lead
 ers and the keynote & closing speakers will be announced at a later date.\

 ound\nUrban Analytics (UA) and Smart Cities (SC) degree programs are becom
 ing more common in the U.S. and globally. Often\, these programs don’t h
 ave a ‘plan’ for how technology and data analysis will tackle real wor
 ld issues\, or an understanding of how different perspectives on race\, et
 hnicity\, gender\, sexual-orientation\, disability and poverty status (and
  more) may add crucial variables to the study of urban analytics.\n\nAltho
 ugh the UA field is data-rich\, the questions and studies in this field ma
 y be ill-suited for helping cities reach the most vulnerable citizens\, or
  how to best empower UA students to positively impact to the city and its 
 people. Because these fields were founded with technocratic and engineerin
 g problem-solving ideals (values inherent to analytics and ‘smart’ end
 eavors)\, the research and thought leadership in UA ad SC lacks the voices
  and input of the typical urbanite and those most in need\, although it co
 ntributes powerful methods and draws talent.\n\nResearch Contribution\nWe 
 will be generating solutions for how our research and teaching can include
  a more diverse body of tacit knowledge from the urban community and how c
 an we solve real-life problems with data analytics? We will be developing 
 strategies and recommending formal research frameworks (mixed-method\, mul
 ti-scale\, validating-by-interview\, etc.) to guide UA and SC research tow
 ards championing citizen voices and helping people.\n\nOur task is to have
  meaningful conversations and develop a guiding agenda that can serve as a
 n ‘intervention’ that is needed as UA and SC fields mature. Without th
 is discussion\, these fields may not adopt the kinds of sensitivities towa
 rds diversity\, inclusion and the human experience\, that it needs to best
  serve the people. The agenda will help put forth:\n\n- A plan to put cruc
 ial information into the hands of the city’s most vulnerable populations
 .\n\n- Methods for using technology to collect data on spatial behaviors i
 n a safe\, privacy-securing way\, and using the information to optimize lo
 cations of services and facilities.\n\n- Designs for tech education for di
 sadvantaged and underrepresented populations at multiple levels.\n\n- How 
 to listen to and learn from citizens who need help and have first-hand per
 spectives (i.e. tacit knowledge) on the urban ecosystem.\n\n- Open ended d
 iscussion on how to connect urban analytics to common-sense urban problems

 ture with Professor Abigail Stewart\, who will speak on "Creating an Inclu

 s welcome to attend and enjoy a reception following the lecture!\n\nAbout 
 Abigail J. Stewart\nDr. Abigail J. Stewart is the Sandra Schwartz Tangri D
 istinguished University Professor of Psychology and Women's Studies at the
  University of Michigan. She served as director of the University of Michi
 gan ADVANCE Program\, 2001-2016\, before which she held a number of other 
 administrative positions. She holds degrees from Wesleyan University\, Lon
 don School of Economics\, and Harvard University. Her current research foc
 uses on academic and life experiences related to race\, class and gender\,
  and on political attitudes and activision.\n\nDr. Stewart's recent book\,
  with Virginia Valian\, is called An Inclusive Academy: Achieving Diversit
 y and Excellence (MIT Press\, 2018):\n\nHow colleges and universities can 
 live up to their ideals of diversity\, and why inclusivity and excellence 
 go hand in hand.\n\nMost colleges and universities embrace the ideals of d
 iversity and inclusion\, but many fall short\, especially in the hiring\, 
 retention\, and advancement of faculty who would more fully represent our 
 diverse world—in particular women and people of color. In this book\, Ab
 igail Stewart and Virginia Valian argue that diversity and excellence go h
 and in hand and provide guidance for achieving both.\n\nStewart and Valian
 \, themselves senior academics\, support their argument with comprehensive
  data from a range of disciplines. They show why merit is often overlooked
 \; they offer statistics and examples of individual experiences of exclusi
 on\, such as being left out of crucial meetings\; and they outline institu
 tional practices that keep exclusion invisible\, including reliance on pro
 xies for excellence\, such as prestige\, that disadvantage outstanding can
 didates who are not members of the white male majority.\n\nPerhaps most im
 portant\, Stewart and Valian provide practical advice for overcoming obsta
 cles to inclusion. This advice is based on their experiences at their own 
 universities\, their consultations with faculty and administrators at many
  other institutions\, and data on institutional change. Stewart and Valian
  offer recommendations for changing structures and practices so that peopl
 e become successful in ways that benefit everyone. They describe better wa
 ys of searching for job candidates\; evaluating candidates for hiring\, te
 nure\, and promotion\; helping faculty succeed\; and broadening rewards an
 d recognition.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.edu/node/633364#0

 \, Public\, Undergraduate students\nStatus: published\n\nOverheating light
 ing instruments coupled with human error are a leading cause of intraopera
 tive fires and patient burns. The healthcare system refers to these as “
 never events” so they should never happen\, right? But\, data suggests t
 hat they occur more than twice a day. This was a red flag for Jackson Medi
 cal Co-founders James Rains and Kamil Makhnejia.\n\nAt the Georgia Institu
 te of Technology\, Rains and Makhnejia began conceptualizing GloShield™ 
 to address this safety issue. They then brought on to the team Dr. Spencer
  Kozin\, a local Atlanta urologist\, who not only resonated with the safet
 y issue being addressed\, but also provided clinical expertise to the team
 .\n\nTogether\, the future Jackson Medical team knew they had a great base
  concept but to successfully commercialize the idea\, they would need an a
 dditional outside design and development perspective. “We knew that we h
 ad an innovative concept and that there is nothing like GloShield currentl
 y on the market\, but needed to ensure that we were taking the correct ste
 ps that would help us reach commercialization in a timely and cost-efficie
 nt manner\,” Rains said.\n\nProfessor Rains\, Dr. Kozin\, Mr. Makhnejia 
 will discuss the questions researchers and innovators must answer and what
  they should anticipate from a funding and development timeline standpoint
  at the earliest stages of the pathway in their medical product concept’
 s journey toward commercialization.\n\nLunch will be provided free of char
 ge for those who attend in person.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.edu/no

 ve been very successful in performing tasks where the inputs are well defi
 ned and known in advance. Automotive and electronic manufacturing are the 
 classic success stories where robotic systems have demonstrated incredible
  value for the industry. In unstructured manufacturing\, the inputs of the
  system can vary significantly\, but the outputs of the system are defined
 . Food and agriculture production are examples of this type of unstructure
 d manufacturing problem\, but traditional manufacturing is also moving in 
 this direction as robotics move beyond welding and painting. This presenta
 tion will give examples of systems that integrate advanced perception and 
 control technologies into robotic systems to perform complex tasks like cu
 tting\, grasping\, and manipulation of objects in an unstructured environm

 \nComposite Materials: The growing pains of a "young technology" destined 
 for a very bright future\n\nComposites are a young and unique class of mat
 erials that provide engineering freedom and integration of parts and funct
 ions. In the last 30 years\, composites have evolved from niche to mainstr
 eam thanks to major advances in chemistry\, material science and automatio
 n. However\, the industry is still not extracting the full potential of th
 e technology to maximize performance\, increase production rates and reduc
 e total cost of ownership. The future widespread adoption of composites ac
 ross multiple markets will be driven by innovations in high throughput man
 ufacturing\, multi-functionality\, environmental sustainability\, simulati
 on and modelling.\n\nDate: Friday\, April 17th\nTime: 11AM – 12:15 PM (l
 unch following in the GTMI atrium)\nLocation:\nGTMI Auditorium #101\nGeorg

 rof. Marilyn Smith]\n\nwill defend a doctoral thesis entitled\,\n\nA Refin
 ed Potential Theory for the Incompressible Unsteady Subcritical-Reynolds n
 umber Flows on Canonical Bluff Bodies\n\nOn\n\nTuesday\, May 5 at 2:00 p.m
 .\nBluejeans: [1]\n\nAbstract\n\nClassical potential theory falls short of
  reconciling the actions of fluid viscosity and frictional forces in an ac
 tual flow with the theoretical analysis of such a flow. As such\, it is un
 able to predict the important phenomenon of flow separation that leads\, i
 n part\, to the pressure drag experienced by the body in an actual flow. H
 owever\, analytical solutions that theories provide offer huge advantages 
 over numerical and experimental solutions in the understanding of fluid fl
 ows and in design. These are in terms of cost and time consumption.\n\nThe
 refore\, a refinement of Classical potential theory of the flow over a cir
 cular cylinder was carried out to bridge this gap. It was achieved by intr
 oducing a viscous sink-source-vortex sheet on the surface of the cylinder.
  These singularities are modeled as concentric at every location. The vort
 ices are modeled as Burgers vortices\, and analytic expressions for their 
 strengths and those of the sinks/sources are obtained from the classical t
 heory. These are employed to obtain a Reynolds-number-and-time-dependent s
 tream function that captures important qualitative features of the flow. A
  viscous potential function that satisfies the governing equations is then
  derived. It is obtained by defining the viscous stream function on a prin
 cipal axis of the flow about which the vorticity vector is identically zer
 o. Strategies have also been developed to account for the finite extent of
  the cylinder\, to introduce dynamic unsteadiness\, to predict separation/
 reattachment/transition\, to obtain forces\, and to apply the solution to 
 an arbitrary geometry with a focus on spheres and spheroids.\n\nThe refine
 d potential theory was verified against experimental and numerical data on
  the cylinder in an incompressible crossflow at. Its drag prediction is wi
 thin the error bound of measured data. The prediction of other quantities 
 is also within acceptable ranges. Its prediction of the force coefficients
  over the range was validated against experimental data on the cylinder in
  crossflow. There is a good agreement in the trend with slight disparity i
 n magnitude that is in favor of safety for design purposes. The energy spe
 ctra of the wake velocity display the Kolmogorov's Five-Thirds law of homo
 geneous isotropic turbulence. This verifies and validates the unsteadiness
  in refined potential theory as turbulent in nature.\n\nCommittee\n\n- Pro

 ize the impactful interplay between supply chains and pandemics\, across t
 he world and in each locality. The impact of collectively improving pandem
 ic supply chain readiness and response in each of the five world states - 
 healthy\, outbreak\, epidemics\, pandemics\, and recovery - will be highli
 ghted.\n\nThe focus will be on critical and essential supply chains to dem
 onstrate the capital importance of supply chains in fighting and surviving
  a pandemics\, as revealed by the COVID-19 crisis.\n\n- Critical supply ch
 ains support the fight against the pandemic disease by supporting the boom
 ing demand for testing kits\, masks\, respirators\, etc.\, to hospitals an
 d health centers.\n- Essential supply chains provide the food\, health pro
 ducts and goods necessary to ensure survival\, quality of life and recover
 y capability of pandemic-affected populations and economies\, notably subj
 ect to distancing and containment measures.\n\nKey avenues for collectivel
 y and comprehensively enabling effective and efficient pandemic supply cha
 in readiness and response in each of the world states will be presented. T
 hese avenues combine common-sense pragmatic practices to leading-edge conc
 epts and technologies\, notably based on Artificial Intelligence and the P
 hysical Internet. They notably enable:\n\n- Critical and essential supply 
 chain visibility and predictability\;\n- Smart fair decisions relative to 
 critical and essential product allocation\, deployment\, and transportatio
 n\;\n- Keeping a healthy and efficient supply chain workforce\;\n- Repurpo
 sing supply chains and facilities to provide boost in critical and essenti
 al product availability\;\n- Vector-free logistics eliminating disease pro
 pagation through goods and food production\, packaging\, distribution and 
 delivery.\n\nThe presentation results from the interdisciplinary collabora

  with the same interactive components.\n\nCourse Description\nMeeting dema
 nd in a timely and cost-effective manner is important both in public and p
 rivate supply chains\, and heavily depend on the design and operation of t
 hese supply chains. Demand is affected by ongoing factors such as local ec
 onomy\, infrastructure\, and geographic location\, as well as unexpected e
 vents such as natural or manmade disasters or other large-scale disruption
 s. Designing and operating responsive supply chains requires the considera
 tion of uncertainty in timing\, scope\, scale\, and understanding of vario
 us topics such as forecasting\, distribution network design\, and inventor
 y management. This course will examine methods and models for making suppl
 y chain design and operational decisions and explore the significant value
  that is obtained through informed decision-making in advance of an unpred
 ictable event or long-term strategy for meeting the need of customers and 
 beneficiaries.\n\nWho Should Attend\nThis course is designed for represent
 atives from governmental or non-governmental organizations\, private corpo
 rations\, military\, and foundations\, including but not limited to senior
  executives overseeing administrative and operational functions of an orga
 nization\, logistics and supply chain managers\, program managers\, direct
 ors of field operations\, directors of emergency/disaster preparedness and
  response\, and public health professionals.\n\nHow You Will Benefit\n- Pr
 ovide immediate impact to your organization through learnings gained from 
 applied and real-world case studies.\n- Learn to bring NGOs\, businesses\,
  or government entities together to enhance collaboration\, cooperation\, 
 and communication.\n- Discover current trends and procedures to help organ
 izations and team members get and stay ahead of the curve.\n- Build a crit
 ical knowledge base to make tactical decisions around inventory\, routing\
 , and distribution.\n- Deliver best practices to measure and evaluate the 
 efficiency\, impact\, and outcomes of focused initiatives or ongoing logis
 tics and supply chain operations.\n- Transform the health and humanitarian
  sectors with increased capacity to participate in planning and strategic 
 decision-making for effective supply-chain management.\n\nWhat Is Covered\

 nWhat Is Juneteenth?\nThis story by Elixabeth Nix was originally published
  on History.com. [5] The story has been adapted for the College of Science
 s.\n\nJuneteenth (short for "June Nineteenth") marks the day when federal 
 troops arrived in Galveston\, Texas in 1865 to take control of the state a
 nd ensure that all enslaved people be freed. The troops' arrival came a fu
 ll two and a half years after signing the Emancipation Proclamation. Junet
 eenth honors the end to slavery in the United States and is considered the
  longest-running African American holiday.\n\nConfederate General Robert E
 . Lee had surrendered at Appomattox Court House two months earlier in Virg
 inia\, but slavery had remained relatively unaffected in Texas - until U.S
 . General Gordon Granger stood on Texas soil and read General Orders No. 3
 : "The people of Texas are informed that\, in accordance with a proclamati
 on from the Executive of the United States\, all slaves are free."\n\nRead

 nOften the lack of cooperation and coordination between organizations or s
 takeholders lead to inefficiencies\, despite having common goals. A system
 s view is needed to ensure appropriate use of scarce resources to meet the
  multiple\, and often conflicting\, short- and long-term goals from multip
 le constituents. This course will focus on conceptual and modeling skills 
 to understand and effectively manage supply chains and operations from a s
 ystems perspective. Models will address system characteristics (e.g.\, dem
 and dependencies) that drive system dynamics and policies to regulate perf
 ormance. Course topics include methods for improving coordination and coll
 aboration\, addressing demand dependencies\, and reliably measuring and ev
 aluating system performance.\n\nWho Should Attend\nThis course is designed
  for representatives from governmental or non-governmental organizations\,
  private corporations\, military\, and foundations\, including but not lim
 ited to senior executives overseeing administrative and operational functi
 ons of an organization\, logistics and supply chain managers\, program man
 agers\, directors of field operations\, directors of emergency/disaster pr
 eparedness and response\, and public health professionals.\n\nHow You Will
  Benefit\n- Identify opportunities for coordination within organizations a
 nd collaboration across organizations for increased efficiency and improve
 d outcomes.\n- Describe the strategic behavior of decision-makers and the 
 impact of the market (or contract) structure on the participant's actions 
 and the overall system dynamics.\n- Define evaluation metrics in alignment
  with the system goals and structure system operations and incentives that
  address and evaluate these metrics.\n\nWhat Is Covered\n- How coordinatio
 n and collaboration can improve supply chain efficiency and effectiveness\
 n- How events\, decisions and actions in one part of a system\, such as a 
 supply chain\, impact other parts of the system\n- System-wide inventory v
 ariability and costs mitigation and reduction\n- Evaluation metrics\n\nPre

SUMMARY:Assistant Professor Levi Wood: Systems Analysis of Neural Immune S
 ignaling in Neurodegenerative Diseases
DTSTART;TZID=UTC;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20200730T200000Z

DESCRIPTION:Status: unknown\n\nDysregulated neural immune activity contrib
 utes to the pathogenesis of diverse diseases\, including Alzheimer’s dis
 ease\, traumatic brain injury\, and lysosomal storage disorders\, among ot
 hers. Understanding neural immune function and identification of strategie
 s to restore healthy or homeostatic immune activity holds the potential to
  transform our ability to treat neurodegenerative diseases. Neural immune 
 activity is a complex system\, consisting of intracellular regulation of d
 iverse immune genes by phospho-signaling cascades that ultimately control 
 glial phenotypes and expression of extra-cellular signaling factors\, such
  as cytokines\, that communicate between cells and exacerbate dysfunction.
  This talk will consist of two parts.\n\nIn the first part\, I will discus
 s our work\, in collaboration with Dr. Amit Reddi\, to illuminate the role
  of the blood factors heme and hemoglobin in potentiating Alzheimer’s di
 sease pathogenesis. We have found that elevation of these factors in Alzhe
 imer’s disease suppresses immune function of the brain’s immune cells\
 , astrocytes and microglia\, including their abilities to clear amyloid be
 ta\, which is the hallmark protein that forms plaques in Alzheimer’s bra
 ins. By integrating extracellular (cytokine) and intracellular (phospho-pr
 otein) signaling data\, we have determined that heme and hemoglobin attenu
 ate normal immune function by stimulating the PI3K/Akt pathway. Moreover\,
  attenuation of the heme biosynthetic pathway reduced amyloid beta patholo
 gy in 5xFAD Alzheimer’s disease mice. Together\, these data illuminate a
 n entirely new aspect of Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis and suggest a 
 novel mechanism resulting in brain immune cell “fatigue\,” which may b
 e treated by attenuating heme synthesis.\n\nIn the second part\, I will di
 scuss our work to identify neuroinflammatory signaling responsible for cog
 nitive deficit after repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). We use
  a weight drop closed head injury mouse model relevant to sports injury in
  which a subset of mice experience cognitive deficit despite having no ove
 rt signs of neuronal injury. Using a non-invasive optical cerebral blood f
 low sensor\, we found that mice with acutely low cerebral blood flow after
  mTBI would suffer long term memory deficit and had elevated acute microgl
 ial activation. Surprisingly\, microglial activation was accompanied by ne
 uronal pro-inflammatory phospho-signaling and cytokine expression\, sugges
 ting for the first time that neural immunity and cognitive deficit depends
  on the interplay between glia and neurons. Moreover\, our ongoing studies
  suggest that inhibition of phospho-signaling using translationally releva
 nt small molecules has the potential to restore cognitive function after r
 epetitive mTBI.\n\nDr. Wood has been an assistant professor in the Institu
 te for Bioengineering and Bioscience at Georgia Tech since August 2015. He
  completed his PhD at MIT where he developed novel microfluidics to identi
 fy mechanisms governing blood vessel geometry during angiogenesis. For his
  postdoc\, Levi\, joined the signaling systems biology laboratories of Kev
 in Haigis and Douglas Lauffenburger at MGH and MIT. While there\, he used 
 engineering systems methods to identify new mechanisms of cell death in Al
 zheimer’s disease and the inflamed intestine. The Wood lab combines engi
 neering systems analysis with multi-dimensional datasets from human tissue
 s\, mouse models\, and 2D and 3D cell culture models to understand the rol
 es of neural immune activity in promoting healthy brain function and in dr
 iving diverse neurological disorders. In addition to identifying underlyin
 g mechanisms of disease\, Dr. Wood has a particular interest in identifyin
 g rapidly translatable treatment approaches using re-purposed drugs for ca
 ncer and other conditions that may already be commercially available or la
 te stage development. Dr. Wood’s areas of study include traumatic brain 
 injury\, Alzheimer’s disease\, and the lysosomal storage disorder\, muco
 lipidosis IV.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  https://www.chemistry.gatech.edu/event/assis

  mTBI would suffer long term memory deficit and had elevated acute microgl
 ial activation. Surprisingly\, microglial activation was accompanied by ne
 uronal pro-inflammatory phospho-signaling and cytokine expression\, sugges
 ting for the first time that neural immunity and cognitive deficit depends
  on the interplay between glia and neurons. Moreover\, our ongoing studies
  suggest that inhibition of phospho-signaling using translationally releva
 nt small molecules has the potential to restore cognitive function after r
 epetitive mTBI.\n\nDr. Wood has been an assistant professor in the Institu
 te for Bioengineering and Bioscience at Georgia Tech since August 2015. He
  completed his PhD at MIT where he developed novel microfluidics to identi
 fy mechanisms governing blood vessel geometry during angiogenesis. For his
  postdoc\, Levi\, joined the signaling systems biology laboratories of Kev
 in Haigis and Douglas Lauffenburger at MGH and MIT. While there\, he used 
 engineering systems methods to identify new mechanisms of cell death in Al
 zheimer’s disease and the inflamed intestine. The Wood lab combines engi
 neering systems analysis with multi-dimensional datasets from human tissue
 s\, mouse models\, and 2D and 3D cell culture models to understand the rol
 es of neural immune activity in promoting healthy brain function and in dr
 iving diverse neurological disorders. In addition to identifying underlyin
 g mechanisms of disease\, Dr. Wood has a particular interest in identifyin
 g rapidly translatable treatment approaches using re-purposed drugs for ca
 ncer and other conditions that may already be commercially available or la
 te stage development. Dr. Wood’s areas of study include traumatic brain 
 injury\, Alzheimer’s disease\, and the lysosomal storage disorder\, muco
 lipidosis IV.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  https://www.chemistry.gatech.edu/event/asst-

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Postdoc
 \, Undergraduate students\nStatus: published\n\nLet's get together for som
 e self-care Tapping\, breathing and centering\, to better manage stress\, 
 and access more calm and clarity.\n\nWhen: Tuesdays & Thursdays in July\, 
 Noon ~ 12:30\, (August ~ TBD)\nWhere: Drop In Zoom (Initial download/setup
  might be required) [01]\nWhat: 1. Casual chat on stress & Tapping intro (
 as needed)\n2. "Tapping" similar to this video " Trauma Tapping Technique 
 [02]."\n\nThe self-help technique to be shared may provide you with some w
 ays to calm down stress and other emotions. However\, it is not a treatmen
 t or prescription for any medial or mental health issues\, nor a substitut
 e for regular medical or psychological care. If you have a medical or psyc
 hological condition\, please consult your doctor or other appropriate lice
 nsed health practitioner. Joining the Tapping session does not constitute 
 a professional relationship between the viewers and the presenters. Choosi
 ng to Tap along means you are taking responsibility for your own self. We 
 hope the session will contain some helpful information to you.\n\n- Mental

 .\, MDiv [06]\n- Video: " How to Make Stress Your Friend [07] " by Psychol
 ogist Kelly McGonigal\n".... the harmful effects of stress on your health 
 are not inevitable. How you think and how you act can transform your exper
 ience of stress. When you choose to view your stress response as helpful\,
  you create the biology of courage. And when you choose to connect with ot
 hers under stress\, you can create resilience....Stress gives us access to
  our hearts. The compassionate heart that finds joy and meaning in connect
 ing with others\, and yes\, your pounding physical heart\, working so hard
  to give you strength and energy. And when you choose to view stress in th
 is way\, you're not just getting better at stress\, you're actually making
  a pretty profound statement. You're saying that you can trust yourself to
  handle life's challenges. And you're remembering that you don't have to f
 ace them alone. "\n- Video: " First Aid for Emotional Distress - Trauma Ta

 ience of stress. When you choose to view your stress response as helpful\,
  you create the biology of courage. And when you choose to connect with ot
 hers under stress\, you can create resilience....Stress gives us access to
  our hearts. The compassionate heart that finds joy and meaning in connect
 ing with others\, and yes\, your pounding physical heart\, working so hard
  to give you strength and energy. And when you choose to view stress in th
 is way\, you're not just getting better at stress\, you're actually making
  a pretty profound statement. You're saying that you can trust yourself to
  handle life's challenges. And you're remembering that you don't have to f

 nJoin the BlueJeans Meeting [1]\n\nABSTRACT\nAntarctic krill (Euphausia su
 perba) is a key component of the Antarctic food web with considerable lipi
 d reserves that are vital for both their own and higher predator survival.
  Krill feed on diatoms\, dinoflagellates and other algal species year-roun
 d\, resulting in high omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids which are essent
 ial for krill health\, growth and reproduction. Krill-derived omega-3 cont
 aining products (particularly eicosapentacnoic acid (20:5w3) and docosahex
 aenoic acid (22:6w3)) are sold as nutraceuticals for human consumption. Kr
 ill oil tablets (sold as an omega-3 supplement) are now one of the fastest
  growing nutraceuticals globally. However\, few attempts have been made to
  link the spatial and temporal variations in krill lipids to those in thei
 r food supply. Knowledge of krill diet and krill lipid dynamics is lacking
  for the Indian and Pacific Oceans\, as most studies have focused on the S
 outh Atlantic Ocean sector where the krill fishery is based. Most research
  voyages are conducted during the summer and all scientific studies are re
 stricted in their spatial and temporal scales. Another major gap in curren
 t Antarctic ecosystem models is the link between environmental drivers and
  their impact on primary production and therefore food availability. Satel
 lite-derived data for biological and ecological measures is still developi
 ng as a tool although outputs such as ocean colour data which can be conve
 rted into chlorophyll a concentrations (a proxy for primary production)\, 
 are becoming more common. This seminar will cover recent developments in t
 he knowledge of spatiotemporal fluctuations of krill lipid biochemistry in
  relation to their environment.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.edu/node/

 \, Undergraduate students\nStatus: draft\n\nThe build up of stress has con
 sequences for the mind and body. Poor sleep\, lack of appetite\, decreased
  productivity\, decreased immunity\, susceptibility to sickness\, are some
  of the few\, and we might find it difficult to get out of the vicious cyc
 le of stress. Except\, nowadays there are some very simple and effective w
 ays to nip the stress bud so we can prevent the over-growth! Come\, join\,
  and learn and try "Tapping" - a simple stress management method to add to
  your tool box. A brief introduction (and actually doing it) is all you ne
 ed so we can better Tap into calm. When: Noon ~ 12:30\, most Fridays start
 ing August 28.\nWhere: Drop In Zoom (Initial download/setup likely require
 d for phone/computer) [01]\nWhat: 1. "Tapping" similar to this video " Tra
 uma Tapping Technique [02]."\n2. Chat and Q&A (Please feel free to leave e

 ttle longer and enjoy a Q&A and some more chat.)\n\n- Mental Health Resour

 are not inevitable. How you think and how you act can transform your exper
 ience of stress. When you choose to view your stress response as helpful\,
  you create the biology of courage. And when you choose to connect with ot
 hers under stress\, you can create resilience....Stress gives us access to
  our hearts. The compassionate heart that finds joy and meaning in connect
 ing with others\, and yes\, your pounding physical heart\, working so hard
  to give you strength and energy. And when you choose to view stress in th
 is way\, you're not just getting better at stress\, you're actually making
  a pretty profound statement. You're saying that you can trust yourself to
  handle life's challenges. And you're remembering that you don't have to f
 ace them alone. "\n- Video: " First Aid for Emotional Distress - Trauma Ta

 rof. Dimitri Mavris]\n\nwill defend a doctoral thesis entitled\,\n\nA Fram
 ework for Fan Stage Conceptual Design Under Distortion\n\nInduced by Bound
 ary Layer Ingestion\n\nWednesday\, October 14 at 12:00 p.m.\nMeeting Link:
  [1]\n\nAbstract\nVarious tightly integrated aircraft concepts have emerge
 d as a result of aggressive performance goals set forth by various organiz
 ations. Most integrated aircraft system configurations exploit the concept
  of Boundary Layer Ingestion (BLI). While the potential benefits of BLI ar
 e huge\, several significant challenges - both on the modeling and design 
 fronts - appear due to BLI. This dissertation focuses on addressing the im
 pacts of BLI induced circumferential flow distortion on the conceptual des
 ign of a fan stage.\n\nDistortion introduces extra losses in both rotors a
 nd stators in addition to increased unsteady rotor response. In presence o
 f incidence swings\, conventional conceptual design tools are inadequate t
 o design optimal rotor blades and generate non-axisymmetric stators\, a co
 ncept that has shown promise in alleviating stage losses due to distortion
 . Besides\, concerns of structural integrity also arise for rotor blades d
 ue to the unsteady loading they experience when rotating in a distorted fl
 ow field. Parametric effects of these phenomena with varying levels of dis
 tortion are quantified\, and a significant portion of the fan stage losses
  are shown to be recoverable using the aero-structural design framework in
 troduced and developed in this dissertation.\n\nThe aerodynamic design fra
 mework is developed through several extensions to the conventionally used 
 multi-meanline method. The inclusion of additional features accounts for f
 low asymmetry\, parametric blade angle optimization\, rotor unsteady perfo
 rmance\, and non-axisymmetric stator design. The model is verified\, and e
 xperiments are performed to evaluate the effectiveness of each modeling el
 ement. Similarly\, the Variational Asymptotic Method (VAM) is proposed as 
 a computationally efficient technique to perform transient structural anal
 ysis of rotor blades. VAM is validated for a variety of loading scenarios 
 and is leveraged to demonstrate the nature of vibratory stresses and highl
 ight the concerns of resonance on a test case. The framework encapsulating
  both aerodynamic design and structural analysis is finally utilized to ex
 plore the design space to minimize vibratory stresses on the blades with a
  small trade-off in the stage efficiency. The fan stage design resulting f
 rom the framework proposed and formulated in this dissertation aims to ser
 ve as a starting point for the preliminary design of a distortion-tolerant
  fan.\n\nCommittee\n\n- Prof. Dimitri Mavris – School of Aerospace Engin

 \, Undergraduate students\nStatus: draft\n\nThe build up of stress has con
 sequences for the mind and body. Poor sleep\, lack of appetite\, decreased
  productivity\, decreased immunity\, susceptibility to sickness\, are some
  of the few\, and we might find it difficult to get out of the vicious cyc
 le of stress. Except\, nowadays there are some very simple and effective w
 ays to nip the stress bud so we can prevent the over-growth! Come\, join\,
  and learn and try "Tapping" - a simple stress management method to add to
  your tool box. A brief introduction (and actually doing it) is all you ne
 ed so we can better Tap into calm. When: Noon ~ 12:30\, most Fridays start

  you create the biology of courage. And when you choose to connect with ot
 hers under stress\, you can create resilience....Stress gives us access to
  our hearts. The compassionate heart that finds joy and meaning in connect
 ing with others\, and yes\, your pounding physical heart\, working so hard
  to give you strength and energy. And when you choose to view stress in th
 is way\, you're not just getting better at stress\, you're actually making
  a pretty profound statement. You're saying that you can trust yourself to
  handle life's challenges. And you're remembering that you don't have to f
 ace them alone. "\n- Video: " First Aid for Emotional Distress - Trauma Ta

 \, Undergraduate students\nStatus: draft\n\nThe build up of stress has con
 sequences for the mind and body. Poor sleep\, lack of appetite\, decreased
  productivity\, decreased immunity\, susceptibility to sickness\, are some
  of the few\, and we might find it difficult to get out of the vicious cyc
 le of stress. Except\, nowadays there are some very simple and effective w
 ays to nip the stress bud so we can prevent the over-growth! Come\, join\,
  and learn and try "Tapping" - a simple stress management method to add to
  your tool box. A brief introduction (and actually doing it) is all you ne
 ed so we can better Tap into calm. When: Noon ~ 12:30\, most Fridays start
 ing August 28.\nWhere: Drop In Zoom (Initial download/setup likely require
 d for phone/computer) [01]\nWhat: 1. "Tapping" similar to this video " Tra
 uma Tapping Technique [02]."\n2. Chat and Q&A (Please feel free to leave e
 arly after Tapping\, as needed\, or you are more than welcome to stay a li
 ttle longer and enjoy a Q&A and some more chat.)\n\n- Mental Health Resour

 are not inevitable. How you think and how you act can transform your exper
 ience of stress. When you choose to view your stress response as helpful\,
  you create the biology of courage. And when you choose to connect with ot
 hers under stress\, you can create resilience....Stress gives us access to
  our hearts. The compassionate heart that finds joy and meaning in connect
 ing with others\, and yes\, your pounding physical heart\, working so hard
  to give you strength and energy. And when you choose to view stress in th
 is way\, you're not just getting better at stress\, you're actually making
  a pretty profound statement. You're saying that you can trust yourself to
  handle life's challenges. And you're remembering that you don't have to f
 ace them alone. "\n- Video: " First Aid for Emotional Distress - Trauma Ta

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Postdoc
 \, Undergraduate students\nStatus: draft\n\nThe build up of stress has con
 sequences for the mind and body. Poor sleep\, lack of appetite\, decreased
  productivity\, decreased immunity\, susceptibility to sickness\, are some
  of the few\, and we might find it difficult to get out of the vicious cyc
 le of stress. Except\, nowadays there are some very simple and effective w
 ays to nip the stress bud so we can prevent the over-growth! Come\, join\,
  and learn and try "Tapping" - a simple stress management method to add to
  your tool box. A brief introduction (and actually doing it) is all you ne
 ed so we can better Tap into calm. When: Noon ~ 12:30\, most Fridays start
 ing August 28.\nWhere: Drop In Zoom (Initial download/setup likely require
 d for phone/computer) [01]\nWhat: 1. "Tapping" similar to this video " Tra
 uma Tapping Technique [02]."\n2. Chat and Q&A (Please feel free to leave e
 arly after Tapping\, as needed\, or you are more than welcome to stay a li
 ttle longer and enjoy a Q&A and some more chat.)\n\n- Mental Health Resour

 ogist Kelly McGonigal\n".... the harmful effects of stress on your health 
 are not inevitable. How you think and how you act can transform your exper
 ience of stress. When you choose to view your stress response as helpful\,
  you create the biology of courage. And when you choose to connect with ot
 hers under stress\, you can create resilience....Stress gives us access to
  our hearts. The compassionate heart that finds joy and meaning in connect
 ing with others\, and yes\, your pounding physical heart\, working so hard
  to give you strength and energy. And when you choose to view stress in th
 is way\, you're not just getting better at stress\, you're actually making
  a pretty profound statement. You're saying that you can trust yourself to
  handle life's challenges. And you're remembering that you don't have to f
 ace them alone. "\n- Video: " First Aid for Emotional Distress - Trauma Ta

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Postdoc
 \, Public\, Undergraduate students\nStatus: published\n\nGordana Vunjak-No
 vakovic\, Ph.D.\nUniversity Professor\nThe Mikati Foundation Professor of 
 Biomedical Engineering and Medicine\nDirector\, Laboratory for Stem Cells 
 and Tissue Engineering\nColumbia University\n\nApproximately 35 million me
 n and women in the United States suffer from TMJ problems\, and as many as
  one in four people experience symptoms of TMJ disorders\, including pain 
 in the chewing muscles\, jaw stiffness\, clicking\, popping or grating\, o
 r the pain of arthritis. The temporomandibular joint\, or TMJ\, is the jaw
  joint that lies in front of each ear\, connecting the mandible (lower jaw
 ) to the skull\, providing the mobility necessary for biting\, chewing\, s
 wallowing food\, speaking\, and making facial expressions.\n\nGordana Vunj
 ak-Novakovic and her research team have been able to grow bone grafts that
  will match a patient’s original jaw bone for facial reconstruction surg
 ery to repair injuries\, disease\, or birth defects. This spectacular adva
 ncement in bone tissue engineering provides all the advantages of the body
 ’s original jaw bone. The team used real bone as a scaffold to grow the 
 new TMJ graft. Taking the knee joints of calves\, they stripped them of al
 l their living cells and carved them into cubic centimeter-size parts of a
  human jaw joint.\n\nUsing mesenchymal stem cells\, which can differentiat
 e into many cell types\, to seed the scaffolding\, they fed them with stre
 ams of nutrients\, growth factors\, and oxygen in a bioreactor. The next s
 tep will be to determine the best way to grow blood vessels in the bone gr
 afts to continue their viability.\n\nIn another research area\, Vunjak-Nov
 akovic is engineering thick\, vascularized\, and electromechanically funct
 ional cardiac tissue\, by culturing stem cells\, the actual “tissue engi
 neers\,” on a channeled elastomer scaffold perfused with culture medium 
 containing oxygen carriers\, to mimic blood flow. This research may lead t
 o a heart patch that could be laid over injured heart tissue to restore no
 rmal function in someone who has suffered a heart attack.\n\n“As a biome
 dical engineer actively involved in this field\, I look forward to unlocki
 ng the full regenerative potential of human stem cells\, so we can cure di
 sease and live longer than our failing organs\,” she said.\n\nHer lab ho
 sts the Bioreactor Core of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Tissue 
 Engineering Resource Center. “This sophisticated bioreactor and imaging 
 instrumentation has moved stem cell research from the ‘flat biology’ o
 f petri dishes to controllable models of high biological fidelity\, which 
 can be studied in real time to observe the interacting factors mediating s
 elf-renewal and differentiation of stem cells\,” said Vunjak-Novakovic. 
 “We now have the capacity to develop entirely new research paradigms and
  approaches to engineering human tissues.”\n\nIn 2002\, Vunjak-Novakovic
  was elected a fellow of the American Institute for Medical and Biological
  Engineering. In 2007\, she gave the Director’s lecture at the NIH\, as 
 the first woman engineer to receive this distinction. She was inducted int
 o the Women in Technology International Hall of Fame in 2008\, elected to 
 the New York Academy of Sciences in 2009\, and\, in 2010\, received the Cl
 emson Award of the Biomaterials Society for contribution to literature.\n\

 \, Undergraduate students\nStatus: draft\n\nThe build up of stress has con
 sequences for the mind and body. Poor sleep\, lack of appetite\, decreased
  productivity\, decreased immunity\, susceptibility to sickness\, are some
  of the few\, and we might find it difficult to get out of the vicious cyc
 le of stress. Except\, nowadays there are some very simple and effective w
 ays to nip the stress bud so we can prevent the over-growth! Come\, join\,
  and learn and try "Tapping" - a simple stress management method to add to
  your tool box. A brief introduction (and actually doing it) is all you ne
 ed so we can better Tap into calm. When: Noon ~ 12:30\, most Fridays start
 ing August 28.\nWhere: Drop In Zoom (Initial download/setup likely require

 are not inevitable. How you think and how you act can transform your exper
 ience of stress. When you choose to view your stress response as helpful\,
  you create the biology of courage. And when you choose to connect with ot
 hers under stress\, you can create resilience....Stress gives us access to
  our hearts. The compassionate heart that finds joy and meaning in connect
 ing with others\, and yes\, your pounding physical heart\, working so hard
  to give you strength and energy. And when you choose to view stress in th
 is way\, you're not just getting better at stress\, you're actually making
  a pretty profound statement. You're saying that you can trust yourself to
  handle life's challenges. And you're remembering that you don't have to f
 ace them alone. "\n- Video: " First Aid for Emotional Distress - Trauma Ta

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Postdoc
 \, Undergraduate students\nStatus: draft\n\nThe build up of stress has con
 sequences for the mind and body. Poor sleep\, lack of appetite\, decreased
  productivity\, decreased immunity\, susceptibility to sickness\, are some
  of the few\, and we might find it difficult to get out of the vicious cyc
 le of stress. Except\, nowadays there are some very simple and effective w
 ays to nip the stress bud so we can prevent the over-growth! Come\, join\,
  and learn and try "Tapping" - a simple stress management method to add to
  your tool box. A brief introduction (and actually doing it) is all you ne
 ed so we can better Tap into calm. When: Noon ~ 12:30\, most Fridays start
 ing August 28.\nWhere: Drop In Zoom (Initial download/setup likely require
 d for phone/computer) [01]\nWhat: 1. "Tapping" similar to this video " Tra
 uma Tapping Technique [02]."\n2. Chat and Q&A (Please feel free to leave e
 arly after Tapping\, as needed\, or you are more than welcome to stay a li
 ttle longer and enjoy a Q&A and some more chat.)\n\n- Mental Health Resour

 ogist Kelly McGonigal\n".... the harmful effects of stress on your health 
 are not inevitable. How you think and how you act can transform your exper
 ience of stress. When you choose to view your stress response as helpful\,
  you create the biology of courage. And when you choose to connect with ot
 hers under stress\, you can create resilience....Stress gives us access to
  our hearts. The compassionate heart that finds joy and meaning in connect
 ing with others\, and yes\, your pounding physical heart\, working so hard
  to give you strength and energy. And when you choose to view stress in th
 is way\, you're not just getting better at stress\, you're actually making
  a pretty profound statement. You're saying that you can trust yourself to
  handle life's challenges. And you're remembering that you don't have to f
 ace them alone. "\n- Video: " First Aid for Emotional Distress - Trauma Ta

  Prof. Mavris)\n\nwill defend a doctoral thesis entitled\,\n\nStructural A
 nalysis and Optimization of Aircraft Wings Through Dimensional Reduction\n
 \nOn\n\nTuesday\, December 15\, 2020 at 9:00 a.m.\n[1]\n\nAbstract\nFedera
 l Aviation Regulations (FARs) are critical drivers of aircraft design. Ear
 ly-stage aircraft design involves a tight coupling between structural dyna
 mics\, aerodynamics\, and flight mechanics\, with time-dependent loads ari
 sing from the considerations of the FARs. The current state-of-the-art dec
 ouples the time-domain simulation from the structural failure computation 
 due to high computational costs associated with time-domain structural fai
 lure computation. The need to account for the dynamic loads specified by t
 he FARs while simultaneously achieving low structural weight for fuel effi
 ciency in early-stage aircraft design motivates the following question: Ho
 w to enable computationally efficient structural analysis and optimization
  of early-stage aircraft wing design\, considering dynamics?\n\nExisting m
 ethods simplify the dynamic loads to equivalent static ones and design the
  structure using shell-based analysis. Other literature approaches use com
 putationally efficient beam models for structural sizing but make assumpti
 ons on the geometry and/or material distribution. Higher-order beam theori
 es for structural analysis have been successfully applied to the design of
  slender structures subjected to time-dependent loads\, like rotorcraft bl
 ades. While aircraft wings can be considered slender structures\, aperiodi
 city\, and inhomogeneity along the span render beam theory ineffective.\n\
 nThe present work aims to bridge this gap by proposing a method for analyz
 ing 3-D structures through dimensional reduction. The use of the Variation
 al Asymptotic Method (VAM) is explored for the systematic reduction of 3-D
  structures to 1-D models and further\, recover 3-D stresses and strains a
 fter solving the 1-D problem.\n\nA stiffness matching approach is proposed
  to dimensionally reduce 3-D features such as stiffeners by locally smeari
 ng them on the base plate. The proposed method allows for stiffeners of va
 rying dimensions\, topology\, and spacing to be smeared. The stiffness mat
 ching further allows the beam cross-sectional properties computed from VAM
  to be equal to a box-beam cross-section. The equivalence enables the use 
 of Euler-Bernoulli type analytical stiffness computation while retaining t
 he accuracy of VAM. Analytical expressions allow for rapid evaluation of t
 he beam properties and stress recovery and further permit the use of Autom
 atic Differentiation (AD) to obtain partial derivatives. The proposed stru
 ctural analysis method is applied to the wing structural analysis of a nov
 el distributed electric propulsion aircraft- NASA's PEGASUS concept\, and 
 the open-source CRM.\n\nA general adjoint method for dynamic simulations i
 s presented and applied to a nonlinear Timoshenko beam theory. It combines
  general beam residual equations with an adjoint method to extract gradien
 t information from the load time-history. Aggregated constraints implement
 ed for sizing are stress-based\, combining axial stresses at the beam corn
 ers with shear stresses from torsion and external loads at both corners an
 d mid-sections. CasASDi\, an open-source tool for nonlinear optimization a
 nd algorithmic differentiation\, is used to generate expressions and calcu
 late derivatives for the relevant equations used for analysis and optimiza
 tion. Numerical tests are conducted to test the accuracy of the adjoint co
 mputations and scalability as the number of design variables increase. A s
 tructural optimization framework is developed for the beam-based dynamic a
 nalysis method presented\, allowing for the structure's sizing under stren
 gth-based failure considerations. The PEGASUS concept is used as a testbed
  to demonstrate the sizing capabilities. The structure is sized for FARs s
 pecified maneuver loads– static 2.5g and -1.0g\, and dynamic gusts.\n\nF
 indings show that: 1) the use of VAM allows for the systematic extraction 
 of beam properties for aircraft wings\, 2) the displacement and stress res
 ponse of the aircraft using beam models match reasonably well against thos
 e produced by shell-based models\, 3) for dynamic simulations\, the derive
 d adjoint method computes accurate gradients efficiently to be used in str
 uctural optimization\, 4) sizing of aircraft wings for FARs specified mane
 uvers using the proposed approach produces a 6% error compared to the shel
 l-based method\, but with a 7.8x speed-up.\n\nThe proposed approach provid
 es improvements on the existing literature methods- it is computationally 
 efficient\, provides reasonable accuracy for early-stage structural sizing
  and weight prediction\, and includes dynamic effects. The computational e
 fficiency makes it well-suited for many-query applications like optimizati
 on\, uncertainty quantification\, and generating data for surrogate modeli
 ng.\n\nCommittee\n\n- Prof. Dimitri N. Mavris – School of Aerospace Engi

 tructured Environments"\n\nAbstract: Robotic systems have traditional been
  very successful in performing tasks where the inputs are well defined and
  known in advance. Automotive and electronic manufacturing are the classic
  success stories where robotic systems have demonstrated incredible value 
 for the industry. The tasks performed by the robots almost exclusively inv
 olve the manipulation or interacting with objects whose physical propertie
 s are known a priori and the objects are rigid and dry. In the many manufa
 cturing sectors\, robotic systems must be able to work in an unstructured 
 environment where every product is unique\, deformable and even wet. This 
 presentation will discuss various approaches to enable autonomous solution
 s to these problems. This will include software to minimize manual program
 ming of robots as well systems that integrate advanced perception and cont
 rol technologies to perform complex tasks like cutting\, grasping\, and ma
 nipulation.\n\nBio: Gary McMurray is a Principal Research Engineer and Div
 ision Chief for the Intelligent Sustainable Technologies Division at the G
 eorgia Tech Research Institute. He is also an Associate Director for the I
 nstitute for Robotics and Intelligent Machines (IRIM) at Georgia Tech. IRI
 M serves as an umbrella under which robotics researchers\, educators\, and
  students from across campus can come together to advance the many high-po
 wered and diverse robotics activities at Georgia Tech. The Intelligent Sus
 tainable Technologies Division conducts innovative research to improve the
  human condition through transforming the agricultural and food systems\, 
 sustainable use and access to energy and water\, and safety of people at w
 ork and from pandemics. Mr. McMurray’s research has focused on the devel
 opment of robotic technologies and solutions for the manufacturing and agr
 ibusiness communities\, including the protein and the fruit and vegetable 
 industries. He is an expert in visual servoing – the use of vision for t
 he real-time control of robotics\, and the author of over 50-refereed tech
 nical papers and journal publications in robotics.\n\nMr. McMurray serves 
 on the advisory board for Advanced Animal Systems for the Foundation of Fo
 od and Agricultural Research. He also serves on the Board of Directors for
  the Robotics Industry Association.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.edu/n

 a fledgling electric-vehicle startup with a brash Elon Musk as CEO went pu
 blic in the summer of 2010 at a valuation of $2.24 billion. Fast forward t
 o early 2021\, and Tesla is valued at some $800 trillion\, which marks an 
 appreciation of roughly 36\,000%. Although Tesla made only 500\,000 vehicl
 es in 2020\, it is more valuable than the legacy carmakers such as Toyota\
 , Volkswagen\, GM\, and Ford combined\, producing over 25 million cars in 
 the same year. What is more\, most major car companies are now fully commi
 tted to an all-electric future. How did Tesla accomplish such a dramatic i
 ndustry transformation? How will it play out? How long will it take? What 
 sectors will be affected by the mobility transformation? Who are the winne
 rs\, and who are the losers? And\, perhaps most important\, what does this
