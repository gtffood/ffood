 \nMartin Luther King Jr. once said " Every step toward the goal of justice
  requires sacrifice\, suffering\, and struggle\; the tireless exertions an
 d passionate concern of dedicated individuals." With the United Methodist 
 Church's recent decision to uphold restrictions on same-sex marriage and L
 GBT clergy creating further divides among church leaders and members\, con
 versations about inclusion in the church are more urgent than ever. In thi
 s lunch 'n' learn\, we will hear from faith leaders whose courageous effor
 ts have created positive change for LGBTQIA people across different Christ
 ian denominations. Our panelists will share their experiences of advocatin
 g for inclusion\, dealing with the disappointment of setbacks\, and engagi
 ng and leading others in pushing for transformation.\n\nPlease e-mail Cami

 \nThe Cybersecurity Lecture Series at Georgia Tech [2] is a free\, one-hou
 r lecture from a thought leader who is advancing the field of information 
 security and privacy. Invited speakers include executives and researchers 
 from Fortune 500 companies\, federal intelligence agencies\, start-ups\, a
 nd incubators\, as well as Georgia Tech faculty and students presenting th
 eir research. Lectures are open to all -- students\, faculty\, industry\, 
 government\, or simply the curious.\n\nRSVP [3]\n\nAbstract:\nWhile Artifi
 cial Intelligence (AI) has tremendous potential as a defense against real-
 world cybersecurity threats\, understanding the capabilities and robustnes
 s of AI remains a fundamental challenge\, especially in adversarial enviro
 nments. In this talk\, I address two interrelated problems that are essent
 ial to the successful deployment of AI in security settings. (1) Discoveri
 ng real-world vulnerabilities of deep neural networks and countermeasures 
 to mitigate threats. I will present ShapeShifter\, the first targeted phys
 ical adversarial attack that fools state-of-the-art object detectors\, and
  SHIELD\, a real-time defense that removes adversarial noise by stochastic
  data compression. (2) Developing theoretically-principled methods for cho
 osing machine models to defend against unknown future attacks. I will intr
 oduce a novel game theory concept called “diversified strategy” to hel
 p make the optimal decision with limited risk. Finally\, I will share my v
 ision on making AI more robust under different threat models\, and researc
 h directions on deploying AI in security-critical and high-stakes problems
 .\n\nBio:\nShang-Tse Chen [4] is a Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science at 
 Georgia Tech. He works in the intersection of applied and theoretical mach
 ine learning. His research focuses on designing robust machine learning al
 gorithms for security-critical applications. He has worked closely with in
 dustry and government partners. His research has led to patent-pending cyb
 er threat detection technology with Symantec\, open-sourced adversarial at
 tack and defense tools with Intel\, deployed fire risk prediction system w
 ith the Atlanta Fire Rescue Department. He is a recipient of the KDD Best 
 Student Paper Runner-up Award (2016) and the IBM Ph.D. Fellowship (2018).\

 nsforming Polymers into Hybrid Materials: Processing Kinetics and Applicat
 ions\nMark Losego\, Assistant Professor\n\nGeorgia Institute of Technology
 \n\nAbstract:\n\nVapor phase infiltration (VPI) is a new processing techno
 logy for infusing polymers with inorganic constituents to create unique or
 ganic-inorganic hybrid materials with novel chemical\, electrical\, optica
 l\, and physical properties. These new materials have been used in applica
 tions ranging from energy harvesting to filtration media to photolithograp
 hic hard masks. This talk will focus on our experimental and theoretical d
 evelopment of a fundamental phenomenological model to measure and describe
  the VPI processing kinetics and create a pathway for rational design of m
 aterial composition and structure. By measuring VPI compositional profiles
  as a function of position\, time\, and temperature\, we can extract funda
 mental energy barriers for the sorption\, diffusion\, and reaction process
 es and delineate amongst different rate limiting steps. In our materials d
 evelopment\, we often find that partial infiltration of a polymer film\, f
 iber\, or foam is sufficient to impart desired properties\; so rational de
 sign of the infiltration kinetics can enable desired performance without w
 aste in processing time or materials. Here\, we will demonstrate several e
 xamples including our work to create chemically insoluble polymers and mem
 branes. We find\, for example\, that infiltration depths of about 0.75 mic
 rons are sufficient to yield PMMA chemically insoluble in organic solvents
  regardless of whether it is in a thin film geometry or a macroscopic plex
 iglass object of centimeters in dimension. We are also applying similar me
 thods to microporous polymer membranes to make them insoluble and resistan
 t to swelling in aggressive organic solvents to further expand membrane-ba
 sed chemical separations technology.\n\nBiography:\n\nMark D. Losego is an
  Assistant Professor in the School of Materials Science and Engineering at
  the Georgia Institute of Technology. The Losego Lab focuses on materials 
 processing and develops novel organic-inorganic hybrid materials systems f
 or sustainable energy\, national security\, and technical textile applicat
 ions. The Losego Lab combines a unique set of solution and vapor phase pro
 cessing methods to convert organic polymers into organic-inorganic hybrid 
 materials\, including developing the science to scale these processes for 
 manufacturing. Prof. Losego has over 70 peer-reviewed publications in lead
 ing scientific journals\, and his thermoelectric textile technology has be
 en externally licensed by Thermo-Flex Technologies for commercial developm
 ent. Prof. Losego received his B.S. degree from Penn State University and 
 his M.S. and Ph.D. from North Carolina State University\, all in materials
  science. Prior to joining the materials science and engineering faculty a
 t Georgia Tech in 2014\, he was a postdoctoral researcher at the Universit
 y of Illinois and a research faculty member in Chemical & Biomolecular Eng
 ineering at North Carolina State University.\n\nLinks:\n[1]  http://hg.gat

 \nShimeng Yu\nSchool of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Georgia Tec
 h\n\nAbstract: Neuro-inspired computing is a new computing paradigm that e
 mulates the neural network for information processing. To enable the large
 -scale neuromorphic system\, it is important to develop compact nanoscale 
 devices to support the synaptic and neuronal functions. In this talk\, I w
 ill discuss recent progress in this domain that integrates oxide based syn
 aptic and neuronal devices in neuromorphic hardware such as machine/deep l
 earning accelerators. First\, I will discuss the desired characteristics o
 f HfO2 based resistive synaptic devices (e.g. analog multilevel states\, w
 eight tuning linearity\, variation/noises) and NbO2 based oscillation neur
 on devices\, and show the principles of offline training and online traini
 ng. Next\, I will introduce the crossbar array architecture to efficiently
  implement the weighted sum and weight update operations that are commonly
  used in the machine/deep learning algorithms\, and show array-level exper
 imental demonstrations for these key operations. Lastly\, I will show our 
 recent work on doped HfO2 based ferroelectric transistor based synaptic ce
 ll design that overcomes the challenges to achieve high training accuracy 
 for online training.\n\nBio: Shimeng Yu is an associate professor of elect
 rical and computer engineering at Georgia Tech. He received the B.S. degre
 e in microelectronics from Peking University in 2009\, and the M.S. degree
  and Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University in 20
 11 and 2013\, respectively. From 2013 to 2018\, he was an assistant profes
 sor of electrical and computer engineering at Arizona State University. Pr
 of. Yu’s research interests are nanoelectronic devices and circuits for 
 energy-efficient computing systems. His expertise is on the emerging non-v
 olatile memories (e.g.\, RRAM\, ferroelectrics) for different applications
 \, such as machine/deep learning accelerator\, neuromorphic computing\, mo
 nolithic 3D integration\, and hardware security\, etc. Among Prof. Yu’s 
 honors\, he was a recipient of the DOD-DTRA Young Investigator Award in 20
 15\, the NSF Faculty Early CAREER Award in 2016\, the ASU Fulton Outstandi
 ng Assistant Professor in 2017\, the IEEE Electron Devices Society (EDS) E

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Postdoc
 \, Public\, Undergraduate students\nStatus: published\n\nThis symposium pr
 esents the current state-of-the-art of the Shape Machine\, a new computati
 onal\, visual and disruptive technology\, to leading experts in various fi
 elds including AI\, engineering\, computer science\, mathematics and desig
 n to review\, discuss\, and envision the field of shape cognition and comp
 uting at Georgia Tech.\n\nThe Shape Machine is a new computational technol
 ogy that fundamentally redefines the way shapes are represented\, indexed\
 , queried and operated upon. Its foregrounding of visual rules (shape rule
 s drawn in a 2D or 3D modeling system) over symbolic rules (instructions d
 efined in some programming language) provides a robust technology for engi
 neers\, computer scientists\, designers\, students and educators\, and in 
 general academics and professionals who use drawings and visual models to 
 develop and communicate their ideas.\n\nThe Shape Machine is currently dev
 eloped at the Shape Computation Lab at the School of Architecture\, Colleg
 e of Design\, in collaboration with the Schools of Mathematics and Interac
 tive Computing at the Colleges of Science and Computing at Georgia Institu
 te of Technology.\n\nRegister Here [2]\n\nProgram\n8:30 - 9:00 AM - Regist

 , Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\nStatus: published\n\nAbstract
 :\n\nThis talk explores the massive transformation taking place in US and 
 global healthcare now that EMRs are widely adopted and a practical API-bas
 ed interoperability framework is being broadly utilized by companies from 
 Google to Apple to Blue Cross and is being mandated by the federal governm
 ent. The ramifications are far reaching and offer promise of a safer\, mor
 e efficient and more effective care delivery system in part through the ac
 hievement of the long held goal of patient engagement in maintaining healt
 h and managing disease once it has developed. The FHIR standard is explain
 ed and its applications are illustrated through examples of cutting edge p
 roducts and research being done here at Georgia Tech\, Emory and elsewhere
 .\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\nAfter a long career in health informatics\, Dr. Braun
 stein has been a professor of the practice in the School of Interactive Co
 mputing for a decade. He developed Introduction to Health Informatics\, a 
 popular graduate seminar\, both on campus and as part of the OMSCS program
 . This talk is based on his latest book Health Informatics on FHIR: How HL
 7's New API is Transforming Healthcare (Springer\, 2018). He offers a popu
 lar free\, public MOOC on Coursera and will soon be posting an updated ver
 sion on edX. He is currently on leave working at CSIRO and the University 
 of Queensland in Brisbane on a novel application of health informatics to 
 medical education.\n\nHow to watch: If you can't make the event in person 
 you can Live Stream or watch the Recording (one week after event).\n\nLink

 \nThe Cybersecurity Lecture Series at Georgia Tech [2] is a free\, one-hou
 r lecture from a thought leader who is advancing the field of information 
 security and privacy. Invited speakers include executives and researchers 
 from Fortune 500 companies\, federal intelligence agencies\, start-ups\, a
 nd incubators\, as well as Georgia Tech faculty and students presenting th
 eir research. Lectures are open to all -- students\, faculty\, industry\, 
 government\, or simply the curious.\n\nRSVP [3]\n\nAbstract:\nVerifying th
 e identity claim of a caller is challenging to both enterprises and indivi
 duals. Blindly trusting the caller is not an option\; however\, building t
 rust is difficult because the caller’s phone number is easily spoofed an
 d the answers to knowledge-based questions are often available on the Inte
 rnet through historical data breaches and social media. Furthermore\, mobi
 le apps that prevent incoming spam/scam calls can fail to protect the user

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Postdoc
 \, Public\, Undergraduate students\nStatus: published\n\nThe nation’s fu
 ture energy directions are being driven by decentralization and decarboniz
 ation. There has been an explosion in deployment of wind power and solar e
 nergy in the last five years\, to the extent that renewable power has beco
 me the largest new contributor to new electric power capacity. The decentr
 alized nature of these sources\, as well as their intermittent character\,
  is introducing many challenges to the electric grid. These trends\, coupl
 ed with growing electrification of transport and cybersecurity concerns\, 
 imply that changes are needed in how the grid is integrated with electrici
 ty users\, managed\, and controlled. This talk will describe a path forwar
 d for the future grid and discuss research to achieve a sustainable future
  for the use of energy\, based upon scenarios developed by the National Re
 newable Energy Laboratory.\n\n(Lunch reception immediately following semin

 \nThe 2019 Karlovitz Lecture and a Frontiers in Science Lecture to celebra
 te 2019\, the International Year of the Periodic Table\nThe 2019 Karlovitz
  Lecture will be delivered by best-selling author Sam Kean.\n\nKean's book
  about the periodic table\, "The Disappearing Spoon\," answers many uncomm
 on questions about chemical elements: Why did Gandhi hate iodine? Why did 
 the Japanese kill Godzilla with missiles made of cadmium? How did radium n
 early ruin Marie Curie’s reputation? And why did tellurium lead to the m
 ost bizarre gold rush in history?\n\nAccording to Kean\, the periodic tabl
 e is one of humanity’s crowning scientific achievements\, but it’s als
 o a treasure trove of passion\, adventure\, betrayal\, and obsession.\n\nA
 bout the Speaker\nBest-selling author Sam Kean’s book “The Disappearin
 g Spoon” delves into every element in the periodic table and explains ea
 ch one’s role in science\, money\, mythology\, war\, the arts\, medicine
 \, alchemy\, and other areas of human history\, from the Big Bang through 
 the end of time.\n\nIn addition to “The Disappearing Spoon\,” Sam Kean
  has several other titles on the New York Times bestselling list: “Caesa
 r’s Last Breath\,” “The Dueling Neurosurgeons\,” and “The Violin
 ist’s Thumb.” All of his books were named Amazon top science books of 
 the year. His work has been featured on NPR’s “Radiolab\,” “All Th
 ings Considered\,” and “Fresh Air.”\n\nSam Kean will sign books afte
 r the lecture.\nAbout the Karlovitz Lecture\nThe lecture is made possible 
 by an endowment in memory of College of Sciences Dean Les Karlovitz\, who 
 served as dean for 16 years until 1989. Seeking to broaden intellectual di
 scourse on campus\, the series focuses on speakers whose work has led them
  to stretch across disciplinary boundaries.\n\nAbout Frontiers in Science 
 Lectures\nLectures in this series are intended to inform\, engage\, and in
 spire students\, faculty\, staff\, and the public on developments\, breakt
 hroughs\, and topics of general interest in the sciences and mathematics. 
 Lecturers tailor their talks for nonexpert audiences.\n\nAbout the Periodi
 c Table Frontiers in Science Lecture Series\nThroughout 2019\, the College
  of Sciences will bring prominent researchers from Georgia Tech and beyond
  to expound on little-discussed aspects of chemical elements:\n\n- Feb. 6\

 \nThe Cybersecurity Lecture Series at Georgia Tech [2] is a free\, one-hou
 r lecture from a thought leader who is advancing the field of information 
 security and privacy. Invited speakers include executives and researchers 
 from Fortune 500 companies\, federal intelligence agencies\, start-ups\, a
 nd incubators\, as well as Georgia Tech faculty and students presenting th
 eir research. Lectures are open to all -- students\, faculty\, industry\, 
 government\, or simply the curious.\n\nRSVP [3]\n\nAbstract:\nRecently\, t
 he number of cyber threats to power systems has increased at an unpreceden
 ted rate. For instance\, the widespread blackout in Ukrainian power grid o
 n December 2015 was a wakeup call that modern power systems have numerous 
 vulnerabilities\, especially in power substations which form the backbone 
 of electricity networks. There have been significant efforts among researc
 hers to develop effective intrusion detection systems (IDSs) in order to p
 revent such attacks or at least reduce their damaging consequences. Howeve
 r\, all of the existing techniques require some level of trust from compon
 ents on the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) network\; hen
 ce\, they are still vulnerable to sophisticated attacks that can compromis
 e the SCADA system completely. In this talk\, we will introduce RFDIDS a r
 adio frequency-based distributed intrusion detection system for the power 
 grid which remains reliable even when the entire SCADA system is considere
 d untrusted. RFDIDS utilizes a radio receiver as a diagnostic tool to prov
 ide air-gapped\, independent\, and verifiable information about the radio 
 emissions from substation components\, particularly at low frequencies. Th
 e unique feature of RFDIDS is its robustness against replay/spoofing attac
 ks as its measured signal is encoded with the quasi-random distribution of
  the global lightning strokes.\n\nBio:\nTohid Shekari [4] received the BSc
  degree in electrical engineering from the Iran University of Science and 
 Technology\, Tehran\, Iran\, in 2013\, and the MSc degree in electrical en
 gineering from the University of Tehran\, Tehran\, in 2016. He is currentl
 y pursuing the Ph.D. degree in ECE and MSc in Cybersecurity with the Schoo
 l of Electrical and Computer Engineering\, Georgia Institute of Technology
 \, Atlanta\, GA\, USA. His current research interests include cybersecurit
 y in power systems\, intrusion detection in power substations\, power syst
 em resilience\, and power system operation. Mr. Shekari is a recipient of 
 the Best Paper Award in the Hawaii International Conference on System Scie
 nces (HICSS)\, 2018.\n\nLinks:\n[1]  http://hg.gatech.edu/node/620189#0\n[

 ged nature of both the topological correlation from chain connectivity and
  electrostatic correlation from the charges in the system. Strong coupling
  among these long-ranged interactions results in a variety of rich behavio
 r unparalleled in uncharged systems. We will present recent advances on th
 e collective dynamics of charged macromolecules in solutions and hydrogels
 . In particular\, the “ordinary-extraordinary” dynamics\, single molec
 ule translocation through a protein channel under coupled forces\, and the
  newly discovered topologically frustrated non-diffusive dynamics of charg
 ed macromolecules inside charged hydrogels will be discussed.\n\nABOUT THE

 trengthening and Stability in Nanostructured Materials: A Computationally-
 Guided Approach\nGarritt Tucker - Assistant Professor Colorado School of M
 ines\n\nAbstract\n\nEngineering interest in nanostructuered materials has 
 been founded on the potential to improve a myriad of mechanical properties
  such as increased strength/hardness\, while scientific interest stems fro
 m the alternative fundamental mechanisms that are operative. Compared to t
 heir coarser-grained counterparts\, the influence of interfaces (i.e.\, gr
 ain boundaries) becomes more significant in nanostructured materials. Curr
 ent simulation techniques for understanding the mechanics in nanocrystalli
 ne alloys rely on non-physical microstructures\, first-order grain boundar
 y descriptors that poorly capture the complexity of interfacial structure-
 property relationships\, and a lack of quantitative approaches that can ac
 curately capture the specific contribution of different deformation mechan
 isms. In this study\, we propose utilizing higher-order descriptors to imp
 rove our understanding of interfacial-driven strengthening and stability. 
 These descriptors then aid in our boundary network modeling to understand 
 larger-scale polycrystalline behavior by unraveling the complexity surroun
 ding the competition/cooperation between different deformation mechanisms\
 , as a function of grain size. The contribution of interfaces and dislocat
 ion-mediated deformation to the total strain in the material is resolved v
 ia continuum-based kinematic metrics\, while the importance of choosing ph
 ysically-based atomistic microstructures and proper equilibration techniqu
 es is shown. By unraveling the mechanistic origins of strengthening and st
 ability in nanostructured materials\, we demonstrate how such a fundamenta
 l understanding might be leveraged for future inverse materials design str
 ategies.\n\nBiography\n\nProfessor Tucker joined the Mechanical Engineerin
 g Department at Mines in the summer of 2017 as an Assistant Professor and 
 is active in the interdisciplinary Materials Science program. Before joini
 ng the faculty at Mines\, he spent 4 years as an Assistant Professor in th
 e Department of Materials Science and Engineering at Drexel University (Ph
 iladelphia\, PA)\, and 2 years as a Postdoctoral Research Appointee at San
 dia National Laboratories (Albuquerque\, NM) in the Computational Material
 s and Data Science group. While at Drexel\, he was awarded the Outstanding
  Teacher Award in 2015 and the TMS Young Leader Professional Development A
 ward in 2016. Professor Tucker earned his Ph.D. in 2011 from the Georgia I
 nstitute of Technology (School of Materials Science and Engineering)\, and
  a B.S. in 2004 from Westminster College (Salt Lake City\, UT) majoring in
  both Physics and Mathematics. His research ambitions are aimed at integra
 ting high-performance computing\, materials theory\, and novel computation
 al tools to discover the fundamental structure-property relationships of e
 merging materials that will enable the predictive design of advanced mater
 ials with tunable properties.\n\nRefreshments will be served.\n\nLinks:\n[

  Electrocaloric-Based Regenerative Cooling\nJoe Mantese - Research Center 
 Fellow United Technologies Corporate Research Center\n\nAbstract:\n\nIt ha
 s been more than two decades since electrocaloric-based temperature lifts 
 of the order of 20°C were first reported in the ceramic materials and mor
 e than a decade since equivalent lifts were observed in polymeric thin fil
 ms. Yet\, since that time\, the demonstration of even a single high perfor
 mance electrocaloric-based cooling module has not been realized. Indeed\, 
 only modest performance (<5°C total lift) has been achieved when such mod
 ules have been challenged against a temperature incline. Coefficients of p
 erformance (COP) have been either unreported or inconsequential. Conversel
 y\, theoretical models predict the potential for regenerative cooling with
  lifts in excess of 10°C at COPs of ~6. In this talk we examine the cause
  of the shortfall in module performance from a material perspective. We di
 scuss: (1) The impact of performance parasitics. (2) Active area loss due 
 to dielectric breakdown and local arcing. (3) Degraded performance due to 
 stress concentration\, clamping from the electrode metallization and cycli
 c fatigue. Solutions to film and electrode failures can potentially be fou
 nd by using material engineering to improve electrical\, mechanical\, and 
 thermal-caloric properties.\n\nBiography:\n\nDr. Joseph Mantese is a Resea
 rch Fellow at United Technologies Corporate Research Center\, specializing
  in electronic/optical materials\, components\, sensors\, and actuators fo
 r aerospace and commercial system platforms\; with particular emphasis on 
 embedded sensing in extreme environments using RF wireless interconnectivi
 ty for both signal and power. His work on embedded sensing is facilitated 
 by additive manufacturing\, MEMS\, and semiconductor fabrication processes
 . Dr. Mantese’ current responsibilities also include: future sensor and 
 functional material conception and development\, multi-business unit strat
 egic planning\, portfolio development\, and road mapping\; new program and
  project initiatives\; and business and government program development.\n\
 nPrior to joining UTRC\, Dr. Mantese was Department Head and Senior Fellow
  of Delphi Research Laboratories (Materials\, Components\, and Packaging) 
 the central research laboratory responsible for developing advanced techno
 logies for automotive systems\, including those for: safety\, entertainmen
 t\, HVAC\, connection systems\, and emissions control. Before joining Delp
 hi in 1999\, Dr. Mantese was a member of General Motors Research and Devel
 opment Laboratories where he was Section Leader of sensor development. Dr.

 \nTackling the Cocktail Party Problem for Hearing Devices: Solutions\, Cha
 llenges and Opportunities\nAbstract. The cocktail party problem has remain
 ed to be one of the most challenging problems for hearing devices even aft
 er decades of extensive research. In this talk\, we will introduce and dis
 cuss our research on the multi-microphone speech enhancement with an empha
 sis on robust and practical real-time algorithms for hearing devices. We w
 ill first present our research on multiple-microphone speech enhancement u
 sing a microphone array alone. Secondly\, we will present our latest resea
 rch on the multimodal speech enhancement using both brain signals (i.e. EE
 G) and microphone signals in a single joint-optimization framework. In bot
 h cases\, we will use objective and subjective evaluation to demonstrate t
 he algorithms’ effectiveness. Finally\, we will discuss the challenges a
 nd opportunities in deploying these algorithms in the real-world.\n\nBiogr
 aphy.\n\nTao Zhang received his B.S. degree in physics from Nanjing Univer
 sity\, Nanjing\, China in 1986\, M.S. degree in electrical engineering fro
 m Peking University\, Beijing\, China in 1989\, and Ph.D. degree in speech
  and hearing science from the Ohio-State University\, Columbus\, OH\, USA 
 in 1995. He joined the Advanced Research Department at Starkey Laboratorie

 ree food\nStatus: published\n\nABSTRACT\n\nOne of the most important scien
 tific and technological frontiers of our time is the interfacing of electr
 onics with the human brain. This endeavour promises to help understand how
  the brain works and deliver new tools for diagnosis and treatment of path
 ologies including epilepsy and Parkinson’s disease. Current solutions\, 
 however\, are limited by the materials that are brought in contact with th
 e tissue and transduce signals across the biotic/abiotic interface. Recent
  advances in organic electronics have made available materials with a uniq
 ue combination of attractive properties\, including mechanical flexibility
 \, mixed ionic/electronic conduction\, enhanced biocompatibility\, and cap
 ability for drug delivery. I will present examples of novel devices for re
 cording and stimulation of neurons and show that organic electronic materi
 als offer tremendous opportunities to study the brain and treat its pathol
 ogies.\n\nABOUT THE SPEAKER\n\nGeorge Malliaras is the Prince Philip Profe
 ssor of Technology at the University of Cambridge. He received a PhD from 
 the University of Groningen and did a postdoc at the IBM Almaden Research 
 Center. Before joining Cambridge\, he was a faculty member at Ecole des Mi
 nes de St. Etienne and at Cornell University\, and served as the Director 
 of the Cornell NanoScale Facility. His research has been recognized with a
 wards from the New York Academy of Sciences\, the US National Science Foun
 dation\, and DuPont. He is a Fellow of the Materials Research Society and

 put computing are very important tools in modern research and are essentia
 l to making meaningful process on many important problems.\n\nIn this semi
 nar\, lessons learned in the course of serving a large and vibrant computa
 tional research community is described. Examples of troubleshooting and op
 timization of serial and parallel programs are shown. In addition\, the us
 e of optimization and benchmarking is used to show how technical data can 
 be developed to guide users in determination of their research resource re
 quirements and use. An example of using containerization technology to ena
 ble a specialized software stack is also detailed. In conclusion\, some of
  the lessons learned and skills developed during the previous 4 years will
  be shared.\n\nBiography:\n\nDr. Christopher Blanton is an experienced HPC
  professional who has worked with some of the most exciting and innovative
  computational researchers.\n\nHe earned his Ph.D. from Syracuse Universit
 y in Computational and Theoretical Chemistry. During his studies\, he firs
 t became deeply interested in computational research and HPC. After gradua
 tion\, he joined the Pennsylvania State University's Institute for CyberSc
 ience. Dr. Blanton has worked most closely with members of the materials s
 cience community\, as a co-appointed staff member of the Materials Researc
 h Institute and the Institute for CyberScience as well as serving as an IC
 S Associate and member of the ICS Coordinating Committee. He looks forward
  to sharing some of his experiences with the Georgia Institute of Technolo
 gy's computational research community.\n\nLinks:\n[1]  http://hg.gatech.ed

 embrane Biophysics\n\nAbstract:\n\nModern advanced computing has allowed s
 cientists to apply a “computational microscope” to numerous biological
  systems and uncover their physical underpinnings in a manner not feasible
  on smaller computing resources. This seminar will detail the use of super
 computers\, including XSEDE’s Bridges and D.E. Shaw Research’s Anton2\
 , both located at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center\, to conduct large-
 scale simulations of lipid bilayers. Why advanced computing resources were
  necessary will be discussed\, as will steps taken to maximize the computa
 tional efficiency of these simulations.\n\nThis approach\, at the nexus of
  computational science\, physics\, chemistry\, and biology\, may be employ
 ed to understand the behavior of cell membranes\, the lipid bilayers that 
 form the boundary of living cells and control their interaction with the s
 urrounding world. Lipid rafts\, regions of the membrane with distinct phys
 ical properties\, may be modeled in a system of coexisting liquid phases a
 nd simulated by Molecular Dynamics. Extracting lipid physical properties f
 rom the studies’ numerical data revealed new insights into coupling of l
 ipid rafts and communication across the membrane.\n\nBiography:\n\nDr. Mic
 hael Weiner received his undergraduate degree in physics from Yale Univers
 ity and his doctorate\, also in physics\, from Cornell University. He comp
 leted his doctoral research in computational biophysics in the laboratory 
 of Gerald Feigenson\, where he focused on Molecular Dynamics simulations o
 f the biophysical chemistry of lipid bilayers as models of cell membranes.
  Dr. Weiner is interested applying advanced computing techniques to questi
 ons throughout the sciences.\n\nLinks:\n[1]  http://hg.gatech.edu/node/621

 \nBiomaterials-based Optical Metabolite Sensing\n\nFriday June 21st\, 2019
  Noon-1pm\; Room 3029 3rd Floor Krone EBB (with Pizza)\nProfessor Mike McS
 hane\, Department Head\, Biomedical Engineering\, Texas A&M University\nPe
 rsonal health monitoring is becoming increasingly accessible as the ease o
 f producing low-cost\, low-power embedded systems has fueled a rapid growt
 h in consumer products aimed at “measuring me.” Yet\, a major technolo
 gy gap is in the space of continuous chemical sensing. The majority of thi
 s talk will focus on describing our materials-focused solutions and relate
 d optical instrumentation aimed at closing this gap\; it will also describ
 e examples of how the same technology is being applied to various other ap
 plications\, particularly bioreactors for cell manufacturing to and tumor-
 egg models. Our research emphasis has been towards developing miniature\, 
 injectable biosensor implants with microscale and nanoscale organization t
 o enable observation of interstitial biochemistry. These materials provide
  specificity through use of various receptors and enhance sensitivity thro
 ugh optical amplification by phosphorescence or Raman scattering. Further\
 , they employ materials that can integrate naturally with tissue\, such as
  porous gels\, enhancing prospects for accurate\, rapid response and long-
 term monitoring. These studies pave the way for modular sensing systems ba
 sed on sensing microdomains embedded in hydrogels\; the former serve as th
 e selective responsive elements whereas the latter act to immobilize the s
 ensing domains while providing a “friendly” surface to interface with 
 the body. Prototype miniaturized\, dedicated instrumentation to interrogat
 e the implants will also be discussed. Examples of current and potential t
 ranslational activities will be provided and some major remaining challeng
 es to long-term in vitro and in vivo biochemical monitoring will be highli
 ghted.\n\nDr. Mike McShane is James J. Cain Professor II in Biomedical Eng
 ineering at Texas A&M University\, where he serves as Department Head and 
 is also affiliated with Materials Science & Engineering and the Center for
  Remote Health Technologies and Systems. Prof McShane’s primary research
  interests are in biomedical instrumentation and optics\, biosensor techno
 logy\, and biomaterials with emphasis on micro/nanofabrication for respons
 ive materials. In this work\, he has pioneered the use of micro/nanopartic
 les\, capsules\, and hydrogel-particle composites for development of optic
 al biosensing systems and has assisted in commercialization of related pro
 ducts. Professor McShane is a fellow of AIMBE and is a Senior Member of SP
 IE and also IEEE\, for which he has served in numerous elected and appoint
 ed leadership positions including his current role as Past-President of th
 e IEEE Sensors Council.\n\nPizza and Drinks Will be Provided\n\nHost: Shui

 \n\nEarly registration is open for REU students until May 31. Ask your REU
  adviser for the registration link.\n\nThe College of Sciences and iGniTe 
 Summer Launch Program present "Halloween in June\," a costume party and va
 riety show to celebrate the International Year of the Periodic Table of Ch
 emical Elements.\n\nCome in your best costumes inspired by the periodic ta
 ble or chemical elements. Winners of various categories will receive fabul
 ous prizes.\n\nPulsate to the science rock music of Leucine Zipper and the
  Zinc Fingers (LZZF)\nPunk-rock music and science share similar goals—to
  go boldly (loudly?) where no person has gone before. Leucine Zipper and T
 he Zinc Fingers (LZZF) amalgamate music and science as a synthetic cross-d
 isciplinary project to bring science to the people in a decidedly original
  medium.\n\nThis ain’t your typical outreach education or NSF broader-im
 pacts initiative. This is loud-and-proud and scientifically sound rock and
  roll! LZZF performs original rock songs\, and a few select cover-songs\, 
 that are ALL ABOUT SCIENCE! Their songs feature biofilms\, enzymes\, dinos
 aurs\, entropy\, social insects\, and more.\n\nActual scientists (three of
  four are Georgia Tech faculty) and life-long punk rockers compose the ban
 d\, so you can be sure that the lyrics are scientifically valid\, and the 
 tunes are rabidly arousing. See them live and enjoy the spectacle of Earth
 's first genetically modified rock band!\n\nThe band has performed around 
 Atlanta since 2014 and released their first album Atomic Anarchy\, to grea
 t critical acclaim\, in 2018.\n\nThe band’s sound calls to mind the Ramo
 nes\, Joan Jett\, Kiss\, or Iggy Pop. That is\, if those icons wrote songs
  about enzymes… – Carmen Drahl\, Chemical and Engineering News [2]\, 9
 /30/2018\n\nAnd as if the second song on their debut CD Atomic Anarchy\, 
 “We’re a Science Band” didn’t make it clear enough\, their songs a
 re all sort of about science\, and science accessories. But they sure don
 ’t sound like they were cooked up in a sterile lab. Nah\, they kick it o
 ut like they’ve spent years honing their three chords in garages and bas
 ements like all good bands do\, with an uncomplicated\, Ramones-worthy\, g
 et in/get out\, old school punk style.” – Jeff Clark\, Stomp and Stamm
 er [3]\, 10/4/2018\n\nWallow in the dirty science of "Carbon and Cubic Fec
 es" with David Hu\nDavid Hu is an IgNobel Prize winner\, mechanical engine
 ering professor at Georgia Tech\, and author of "How to Walk on Water and 
 Climb Up Walls: Animal Movement and the Robots of the Future."\n\nHuman wa
 ste has substantial resource value: human urine contains phosphorus\, pota
 ssium\, nitrogen\; and human feces contains mostly carbon. David will talk
  about the physics of excretion. In the law of urination\, he will show th
 at animals urinate for a constant duration\, independent of body mass. In 
 their study of cubic feces of the wombat\, he will show how soft intestine
 s can form corners in feces.\n\nLaugh out loud with Lew Lefton's science h
 umor\nLew Lefton is a faculty member in the Georgia Tech School of Mathema
 tics\, the assistant dean of information technology for the Georgia Tech C
 ollege of Sciences\, and associate vice president for research computing a
 t Georgia Tech. With so many roles\, he is a very important person.\n\nBut
  Lew is not just your ordinary VIP or computing/mathematics geek. He's an 
 accomplished and experienced comedian who has done stand up and improv com
 edy with a geeky twist for over 30 years. His unique talents are best summ
 ed up by his business card\, which reads: Lew Lefton\, Mathematician/Comed
 ian\, "He's funny and he can prove it."\n\nMarvel at magic card trick and 
 treats by Matt Baker\nMatt Baker is an internationally renowned Georgia Te
 ch mathematics professor by day and an accomplished magician [4] by night.
  Matt currently serves as associate dean for faculty development in the Ge
 orgia Tech College of Sciences.\n\nAs a magician Matt has performed three 
 times at the invitation-only Fechter’s Finger Flicking Frolic [5]\, the 
 world’s premiere close-up magic convention. In 2018 he recorded a Pengui
 n Live Acts show and lecture in Columbus\, Ohio\, and spent four days in S
 pain studying with Juan Tamariz [6]\, the world’s greatest living close-
 up magician. In July 2019\, Matt will be lecturing at the International Br
 otherhood of Magicians Annual Convention [7] in Scottsdale\, Arizona.\n\nM
 att’s awards for magic include the Atlanta Society of Magicians' Top Dog
  Award and the Greater Atlanta Magician of the Year award.\n\nMatt's magic
  tricks have appeared in several national periodicals. He just published h
 is first book of original magic\, " The Buena Vista Shuffle Club [8]." Wor
 ld-renowned magician Joshua Jay [9] calls it "an excellent\, funny\, and p
 ersonal collection of magic that is a joy to read".\n\nPlus periodic table

 ating micron sized objects in magnetic liquids in a continuous flow throug
 h so-called “ferrohydrodynamics” is a relatively new research field. I
 t has resulted in label-free manipulation techniques in microfluidic syste
 ms and exciting applications such as circulating tumor cells (CTCs) enrich
 ment. It is the goal of this talk to introduce the fundamental principles 
 of ferrohydrodynamics and its recent applications in microfluidic enrichme
 nt of CTCs developed in my lab. The theoretical background of two commonly
  used specificities of manipulation in magnetic liquids will be discussed\
 , including the size and contrast of magnetic property. Pros and cons of c
 ommonly used media of magnetic liquids including paramagnetic salt solutio
 ns and ferrofluids will be introduced. Details of CTCs enrichment applicat
 ion will also be discussed.\n\nBiography: Leidong Mao is a Professor in th
 e School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Georg
 ia in Athens\, GA. He received his PhD in electrical engineering from Yale
  University. He is interested in developing new microfluidic technologies 
 for biological or biomedical applications such as cancer cell isolation an
 d understanding the biological clock.\n\nHosted by the Biomicrofluidics Se

SUMMARY:Introversion as an Ally workshop with Neith Sankofa

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\nStatus: published\n\nThe Web
  of Brilliance ERG and Institute Diversity present the workshop "Introvers
 ion as an Ally\," with Neith Sankofa.\n\nInteracting with leaders and infl
 uencers across many social and cultural lines is a marker of a seasoned pr
 ofessional. Being able to be present\, flexible and “in-the-moment” wh
 ile doing so is a marker of a fully empowered\, exceptional professional.\
 n\nBut what happens when there are challenges… like being an introvert? 
 It begins with recognizing introversion as an ally to the type of insights
  that create full empowerment because of an introvert’s innate ability t
 o be or become internally aware.\n\nIn this workshop participants will rec
 ognize when they (and others) have switched to “automatic” in their in
 teractions. Through integration exercises\, participants will uncover how 
 to counterbalance the tendency to fall into unconscious role-playing (due 
 to the stress of introversion) by authentically engaging their target audi
 ences for maximum success. By getting in touch with what they need and fee
 l\, and creating a toolkit for counterbalancing\, they will begin to creat
 e more ideal conditions for themselves in any situation through expanded i
 nternal awareness.\n\nFree and open to Georgia Tech Staff and Faculty\, bu
 t seats are very limited. You must register to attend.\n\nRefreshments pro
 vided. Introverts\, Extroverts\, and everyone in between are welcome.\n\nR

 erson Foundation NextGen Fund [4] and the Sheth Foundation [5]\, Professor
 s Kim Cobb and Beril Toktay collaborated to expand Professor Cobb’s succ
 essful Carbon Reduction Challenge class to enable students participating i
 n an internship or co-op to plan and implement a carbon reduction project 
 with their employers. Individual students or a team took the initiative to
  identify and execute a plan that reduces their employer’s carbon emissi
 ons\, most often saving their employer money\, over the course of their in
 ternship. Project examples from the class range from creating employee cha
 llenges to reduce their personal carbon emissions\, to changes in building
  lighting schedules\, to more capital-intensive projects such as HVAC modi
 fications.\n\nThe winners of the Carbon Reduction Challenge will be decide
 d based on i) the amount of carbon emissions avoided (whether actual or po
 tential)\, and ii) the level of awareness fostered through the project. Th
 e winning team(s) will be announced at the conclusion of the Finalist Post
 er Expo and awarded cash prizes for their work. First prize is $5\,000\, s

 Near-Field Integrated Magnetic Sensing System for Hardware Security\n\nSpe
 aker: Professor Mai-Khanh N. Nguyen\, VLSI Design and Education Center (VD
 EC)\, The University of Tokyo\, JAPAN\n\nAbstract: Hardware Trojan or spyw
 are circuits operating as hardware backdoors can be implemented and integr
 ated into computer chips\, smart-cards\, and other crypto processors. Hard
 ware Trojan circuits inside a chip is generally harmless in normal operati
 on until they get triggered by a preset internal or external signal to ste
 al data or override and even control the system. Detection of hardware Tro
 jans is very difficult as they are normally in nano-scale sizes and integr
 ated into ICs with high complexity system inside and a huge number of gate
 s. Therefore\, Trojan inspection through destructive reverse engineering m
 ay not ensure the absence of hardware Trojans. In this talk\, I present a 
 demonstration to non-invasively detect hardware Trojan\, analyze and ident
 ify vulnerable portions of cryptographic chips based on magnetic sensing t
 owards cybersecurity applications.\n\nSpeaker Bio: Dr. Mai-Khanh is curren
 tly is an assistant professor at VLSI Design and Education Center (VDEC)\,
  the University of Tokyo\, Japan. He received the Ph.D. degree in Electric
 al Engineering and Information Systems\, The University of Tokyo\, Japan i

  2013 in VDEC. His research interests include integrated RF/mm-Wave circui
 ts\, and magnetic sensing. He is a recipient of Best Paper Awards of the A
 sian Symposium on Quality Electronic Design Symp. in 2010\, the third rank
  of the 9th IEEE NEWCAS 2011\, and of IEEE NEWCAS 2017. He servered as a T

 \, Public\, Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\nStatus: draft\n\nGl
 en Evenbly\nSchool of Physics\, Georgia Tech\nAbstract: Quantum many-body 
 systems are difficult to study because the space of possible many-body sta
 tes is huge: its dimension grows exponentially in the system size. However
 \, thanks to quantum information theory\, progress in understanding the ro
 le of entanglement in quantum many-body systems has revealed that only a s
 mall region of this huge state space is needed for describing relevant qua
 ntum states. Tensor networks\, originally developed in the context of cond
 ensed-matter physics and based on renormalization group ideas\, exploit th
 is understanding of entanglement in order to provide efficient description
 s of many-body quantum states. In this talk I will (i) review our current 
 understanding of many-body entanglement\, (ii) introduce tensor networks a
 s tools for the study of many body systems\, and (iii) give an overview of
  the exciting developments within the tensor network program.\n\nBio: Glen
  Evenbly received the PhD degree in physics from the University of Queensl
 and\, Australia in 2010. His research focuses on the development of novel 
 theoretical and numerical tools for modelling entanglement in quantum syst
 ems. He joined Caltech in 2011 as the Sherman-Fairchild Prize postdoctoral
  fellow and UC Irvine in 2014 as a Simons Foundation postdoctoral fellow\,
  where he continued his work on quantum information and many-bodyphysics. 
 He joined the faculty at the University of Sherbrooke\, Canada in 2016 bef
 ore joining the School of Physics at Georgia Tech in 2019. Glen received t
 he IUPAP Young Scientist Prize in Computational Physics in 2017 for his ex
 ceptional work on developing the tensor network formalism.\n\nLight refres
 hments will be served.\n\nLinks:\n[1]  http://hg.gatech.edu/node/624204#0

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Public\, Undergraduate stud
 ents\nStatus: published\n\nSpeaker: Professor Chien-Chung Lin\, National C
 hiao-Tung University & ITRI\, Taiwan\n\nAbstract:\n\nColloidal Quantum Dot
 s (CQDs) have been working their ways into the next-generation photonic de
 vices. Highly efficient light emitters and absorbers made of CQDs can be d
 emonstrated among various types of materials including CdSe/CdS/CdTe and p
 erovskites. The wavelength tunability\, according to their physical sizes\
 , can be readily suitable for LED displays and solar spectrum management p
 urposes. Meanwhile\, the reliability of these nanocrystals remains one of 
 the most important issues before their full-scale commercialization. In th
 is talk\, we will present our latest work on the improvement of the reliab
 ility of hybrid CQD photonic devices. A brief review on previous achieveme
 nts will also be provided. The compact package and long lifetime features 
 will be the key factors for future successful deployment of such materials
  and devices.\n\nSpeaker's Biography:\n\nDr. Chien-Chung Lin was born in T
 aipei\, Taiwan\, in 1970. He received his B.S.E.E. degree from National Ta
 iwan University\, Taipei\, in 1993\, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in ele
 ctrical engineering from Stanford University\, Stanford\, CA\, USA\, in 19
 97 and 2002\, respectively. His thesis work focused on design\, modeling\,
  and fabrication of micromachined-tunable optoelectronic devices. He joine
 d E2O Communications Inc.\, Calabasas\, CA\, USA\, as a Senior Optoelectro
 nic Engineer in 2002. His main research interests then were in optically a
 nd electrically pumped long-wavelength vertical cavity surface emitting la
 sers. In 2004\, he joined Santur Corporation\, Fremont\, CA\, where he ini
 tially worked as a member of technical staff and became a Manager of Laser
  Chip Engineering later. He had worked on monolithic multi-wavelength DFB 
 Laser arrays for data and telecommunications\, yield and reliability analy
 sis of DFB Laser arrays\, etc. In2009\, he joined the National Chiao Tung 
 University (NCTU) in Tainan\, Taiwan\, where he currently holds the positi
 on of a full Professor. His major research interests are in the design and
  fabrication of novel semiconductor optoelectronic devices\, including LED

 ls Processing Fundamentals for the Self-Aligned Capillarity Assisted Litho
 graphy for Electronics (SCALE) Process Lorraine F. Francis - Professor and
  3M Chair in Experiential Learning University of Minnesota Department of C
 EMS\n\nAbstract:\n\nApplications for circuits and devices printed on flexi
 ble substrates abound\, ranging from wearable diagnostic sensors to large 
 area\, roll-up displays. Continuous printing processes are attractive for 
 manufacturing flexible electronics. However\, two challenges typically ari
 se in this pursuit: (1) creating small feature sizes\, and (2) achieving r
 egistration of multiple functional layers. This presentation will cover ou
 r efforts to address these challenges using a new approach – Self-Aligne
 d Capillarity-Assisted Lithography for Electronics (or SCALE). SCALE invol
 ves imprinting a multilevel open network of reservoirs\, capillaries and d
 evice structures into a UV-curable coating deposited on a flexible substra
 te\, delivering electronically functional inks into the reservoirs by inkj
 et printing\, and using capillarity to selectively fill capillaries and de
 vice structures attached to the reservoirs. The single imprint step create
 s all the structural features needed in the devices and capillary flow cre
 ates self-aligned\, multimaterial devices. To-date we have used SCALE to c
 reate conductive networks\, resistors\, capacitors\, diodes and transistor
 s. This presentation will show advances in device architecture and perform
 ance\, and explore the key processing steps. Special attention will be giv
 en to the continuous roll-to-roll imprinting process\, experiments and vis
 ualizations of liquid flow in open capillary channels\, and unique flow co
 ntrol methods such as a microfluidic diode.\n\nBiography:\n\nLorraine F. F
 rancis is Professor of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science and curr
 ently holds the 3M Chair in Experiential Learning in the College of Scienc
 e and Engineering at the University of Minnesota. She received a B.S. in C
 eramic Engineering from Alfred University in 1985\, and M.S. and Ph.D. in 
 Ceramic Engineering from the University of Illinois in 1987 and 1990\, res
 pectively. She then joined the University of Minnesota. Professor Francis 
 has research interests broadly in the area of materials processing\, inclu
 ding coating and printing processes and microstructure development studies
 . She is also very involved in undergraduate education\, including develop
 ing a project-based learning class for freshmen and authoring a textbook. 
 Professor Francis has received several awards. In 2019\, she was named Col
 lege of Science and Engineering Distinguished Professor\, and in 2014 she 
 received the Horace T. Morse - University of Minnesota Alumni Association 
 Award for Outstanding Contributions to Undergraduate Education.\n\nRecepti

 \nMadhavan Swaminathan\nJohn Pippin Chair in Microsystems Packaging & Elec
 tromagnetics\nSchool of Electrical and Computer Engingeering\nAbstact: A c
 ombination of "Moore" (IC) and "More than Moore" (package) scaling has led
  to the shrinking of electronic systems over the last several decades. As 
 scaling continues beyond CMOS to include advanced devices\, scaling of the
  package needs to continue to enable system scaling\, leading to the integ
 ration and miniaturization of systems. This requires new technologies for 
 package integration which when connected to assembled ICs leads to System 
 on Package (SoP) solutions that have superior performance and size as comp
 ared to current technologies. This presentation will discuss advanced SoP 
 platforms for integration with a focus on heterogeneity for a variety of a
 pplications that include AI\, HPC\, Power Electronics\, mmWave to name a f
 ew. The inter-disciplinary nature of the research will be highlighted base
 d on faculty interactions between four different schools at GT.\n\nBio: Ma
 dhavan Swaminathan is the John Pippin Chair in Microsystems Packaging & El
 ectromagnetics in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) 
 with a joint appointment in the School of Materials Science and Engineerin
 g (MSE)\, and was recently appointed Director of the 3D Systems Packaging 
 Research Center (PRC)\, GT. He also serves as the Site Director for the NS
 F Center for Advanced Electronics through Machine Learning (CAEML). He for
 merly held the position of Founding Director\, Center for Co-Design of Chi
 p\, Package\, System (C3PS)\, Joseph M. Pettit Professor in Electronics in
  ECE and Deputy Director of the Packaging Research Center (NSF ERC)\, GT. 
 Prior to joining GT\, he was with IBM working on packaging for supercomput
 ers. He is the author of 500+ refereed technical publications\, holds 30 p
 atents\, primary author and co-editor of 3 books\, founder and co-founder 
 of two start-up companies\, and founder of the IEEE Conference Electrical 
 Design of Advanced Packaging and Systems (EDAPS)\, a premier conference sp
 onsored by the EPS society. He is an IEEE Fellow and has served as the Dis

 udying CNS delivery systems\n\nABSTRACT\nThe central nervous system (CNS) 
 has a specialized vascular barrier\, the blood-brain barrier (BBB)\, which
  possesses a highly selective barrier function that restricts the permeabi
 lity of drugs\, leading to a high failure rate in the development of CNS t
 herapeutics. However\, it remains difficult with existing in vivo models t
 o conduct mechanistic studies of the barrier function and interactions wit
 h drugs at molecular and cellular levels. This challenge highlights the im
 portance of the development of in vitro models that mimic the physiologica
 l structure and function of the BBB. Despite various efforts\, physiologic
 ally relevant in vitro human BBB models capable of highly precise\, quanti
 tative analysis of drug delivery remain to be developed. In this study\, w
 e present a human BBB-on-a-chip designed to create a 3D astrocytic network
  with reduced reactive gliosis and polarized aquaporin-4\, critical featur
 es of the BBB that has yet to be demonstrated. Our model will provide a re
 liable tool for studying the penetrance of CNS drugs across the BBB.\n\nBI
 O\nSong Ih Ahn is a Ph.D. candidate in Dr. YongTae Kim's lab at Georgia In
 stitute of Technology. Before she started her Ph.D. in 2015\, she received
  her M.S. and B.S. in mechanical engineering from KAIST. Her research focu

 ent of AI in security settings. We present our joint works with Intel whic
 h include the first targeted physical adversarial attack (ShapeShifter) th
 at fools state-of-the-art object detectors\; a fast defense (SHIELD) that 
 removes digital adversarial noise by stochastic data compression\; and int
 eractive systems (ADAGIO and MLsploit) that further democratize the study 
 of adversarial machine learning and facilitate real-time experimentation f
 or deep learning practitioners.\n\nFinally\, we also present how scalable 
 interactive visualization can be used to amplify people’s ability to und
 erstand and interact with large-scale data and complex models. We sample f
 rom projects where interactive visualization has provided key leaps of ins
 ight\, from increased model interpretability (Gamut with Microsoft Researc
 h)\, to model explorability with models trained on millions of instances (
 ActiVis deployed with Facebook)\, increased usability for non-experts abou
 t state-of-the-art AI (GAN Lab open-sourced with Google Brain\; went viral
 !)\, and our latest work Summit\, an interactive system that scalably summ
 arizes and visualizes what features a deep learning model has learned and 
 how those features interact to make predictions. We conclude by highlighti
 ng the next visual analytics research frontiers in AI.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\n

 eness of the impact of implicit bias and facilitate equitable decision-mak
 ing across myriad processes related to faculty evaluations. As a participa
 nt in the workshop\, you will learn the following:\n\n• An introduction 
 to the concept of implicit bias and how these unconscious\, automatic ment
 al processes may impact behaviors such as evaluating candidates during fac
 ulty search and/or RPT processes.\n\n• Empirical research on vitaes\, le
 tters of recommendations\, and teaching evaluations to illustrate the impa
 ct of implicit bias on decisions.\n\n• Effective practices and strategie
 s for faculty search and RPT committees.\n\nThese workshops will be facili
 tated by Julie Ancis\, associate vice president\, Institute Diversity\; Pa

SUMMARY:GVU Center Brown Bag: Richard DeMillo "Usability\, Privacy\, Cyber
 security and the Right to Vote: Why elections are not as simple as they se

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Public\
 , Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\nStatus: published\n\nAbstract
 :\n\nAll modern public elections in the United States use computers called
  voting machines to automate at least part of the voting process. Like all
  computers\, voting machines can be misprogrammed\, misconfigured\, misuse
 d and hacked. Poorly secured data\, open networks\, and aging computing eq
 uipment with known vulnerabilities to malware are all subject to attack. T
 here is substantial evidence that foreign adversaries have infiltrated Ame
 rican election systems and there is growing evidence that election results
  were affected. Federal agencies\, the Intelligence Community\, and congre
 ssional committees all agree that action is required. This talk will focus
  on the unique aspects of elections from a computing standpoint: (1) Why a
 re there not national standards? (2) What cybersecurity tools would make e
 lections more secure? (3) How does the right to a secret ballot affect ele
 ction technology? (4) What is the future of electronic voting in the state
  of Georgia?\n\nIn this talk I will pay special attention to usability and
  privacy problems and point out areas in which improved understanding of c
 ognitive limitations of voters can influence public policy. This work is b
 ased in part on a recent paper entitled “Ballot Marking Devices (BMDs) c
 annot assure the will of the voters\,” by Philip Stark\, Andrew Appel\, 
 and me. This paper can be downloaded here: [2]\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\nRichard 
 DeMillo is the Charlotte B. and Roger C. Warren Professor of Computing and
  Professor of Management\, former John P. Imlay Dean of Computing\, and Di
 rector of the Center for 21st Century Universities at the Georgia Institut
 e of Technology. Author of over 100 articles\, books\, and patents\, he ha
 s held academic positions at Purdue University\, the University of Wiscons
 in\, and the University of Padua. He directed the Computer and Computation
  Research Division of the National Science Foundation and was Hewlett-Pack
 ard's first Chief Technology Officer. He is the 2013 Lumina Foundation Ina
 ugural Fellow which recognized his founding of the Center for 21st Century
  Universities as a “unique institution.” He is also a Fellow of both t
 he American Association for the Advancement of Science and the Association
  for Computing Machinery. He is the author of the influential 2011 book 
 “Abelard to Apple: The Fate of American Colleges and Universities” and
  an award-winning 2015 sequel entitled “Revolution in Higher Education: 
 How a Small Band of Innovators will Make College Accessible and Affordable

 \, Public\, Undergraduate students\nStatus: published\n\nOn Friday\, Septe
 mber 6\, the Robert C. Williams Museum of Papermaking hosts an artists’ 
 talk on the Cut & Paste: Works of Paper exhibit. Join curator Didi Dunphy 
 of the Lyndon House Arts Center and artists Samuel Stabler\, Kalina Wińsk
 a\, and Matt Haffner as they talk about their inspiration and processes fo
 r the works included in the exhibit.\n\nThe reception begins at 6pm\, and 
 the artist talks will start at 7pm. This event is free and open to the pub
 lic.\n\nDidi Dunphy\, exhibit curator\, traveled across Georgia to select 
 contemporary artists to participate. Cut and Paste: Works of Paper examine
 s ways in which working artists manipulate paper to create remarkable and 
 varied works of art. She will lead a conversation with three of the eleven
  artists included in the exhibit\, discussing inspiration\, technique\, an
 d experiences.\n\nThroughout Samuel Stabler’s career\, he has worked and
  re-worked found images. His cut paper works in the exhibit are inspired b
 y sources ranging from the Old Masters to contemporary pop culture. [2]\n\
 nKalina Wińska is an associate professor at Valdosta State University. He
 r mixed-media drawings on paper are inspired by weather analysis: essentia
 lly “abstracted snapshots of cloudscapes visibly marked with human activ
 ity.” [3]\n\nAtlanta-based Matt Haffner is a photographer and mixed-medi
 a and installation artist. Haffner’s works included in the exhibit are m
 ade from humble materials that “are an exercise in simplicity and nuance
 .” [4]\n\nFor more information\, contact Virginia Howell at 404-894-5726

 \nIgor Bargatin\nUniv. of Pennsylvania\, Mechanical Engineering and Applie
 d Mechanics\nAbstract: Recently\, we introduced the concept of plate mecha
 nical metamaterials—cellular plates with carefully controlled periodic g
 eometry and unique mechanical properties—as well as its initial realizat
 ion in the form of freestanding corrugated plates made out of an ultrathin
  film. We used atomic layer deposition (ALD) and microfabrication techniqu
 es to make robust plates out of a single continuous ALD layer with cm-scal
 e lateral dimensions and thicknesses between 25 and 100 nm\, creating the 
 thinnest freestanding plates that can be picked up by hand. We also fabric
 ated and characterized nanocardboard - plate metamaterials made from multi
 ple layers of nanoscale thickness\, whose geometry and properties are remi
 niscent of honeycomb sandwich plates or corrugated paper cardboard. Ultral
 ow weight\, mechanical robustness\, thermal insulation\, as well as chemic
 al and thermal stability of alumina make plate metamaterials attractive fo
 r numerous applications\, including structural elements in flying microrob
 ots and interstellar light sails\, high-temperature thermal insulation in 
 energy converters\, photophoretic levitation\, as well as ultrathin sensor
 s and resonators. I will briefly discuss our experimental progress on all 
 these applications\, including demonstrations of extremely robust thermal 
 insulators that can sustain a temperature difference of ~1000 K across a m
 icron-scale gap\, hollow AFM cantilevers that offer greatly enhanced sensi
 tivity and data acquisition rates\, and macroscopic plates that levitate w
 hen illuminated by light.\n\nBio: Igor Bargatin received his undergraduate
  degree in theoretical physics from the Lomonosov Moscow State University\
 , and a Ph.D. degree in physics and electrical engineering from the Califo
 rnia Institute of Technology\, Pasadena. After postdoctoral appointments a
 t LETI/Minatec (Grenoble\, France) and Stanford University\, he became the
  Class of 1965 Term Assistant Professor in the Department of Mechanical En
 gineering and Applied Mechanics (MEAM)\, University of Pennsylvania. Prof.
  Bargatin’s research interests are focused on micro- and nanomechanical 
 structures for new applications in energy conversion\, ultra-lightweight m
 aterials\, and new mechanisms of levitation. He is a recent recipient of t
 he NSF CAREER award and the Penn Engineering teaching award.\n\nLinks:\n[1

 \, Public\, Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\nStatus: review\n\nS
 ince 2009 women have received a majority of the doctoral degrees granted b
 y U.S. institutions.In several scientific fields women have made great str
 ides\, whereas in a number of STEM areas the progress has been substantial
 ly slower.\n\nin 2017 women received 53% of the doctorates in Biological a
 nd Agricultural Sciences and 70% in the Health and Medical Sciences.In con
 trast\, women earned only 23% of the doctorates in engineering\, 25% in ma
 thematics and computer sciences\, and 34% in the physical and earth scienc
 es.\n\nOver the years\, the percentage of tenure-line female faculty membe
 rs in the physical sciences\, engineering\, and mathematics has remained l
 ow. Findings from an analysis of the responses to surveys and site visit d
 iscussions that involved over 1200 administrators\, chemistry and chemical
  engineering faculty members\, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows 
 will be discussed. The hiring rate of female faculty members and factors c
 ontributing to their career choices will also be addressed.\n\nReception f
 ollows in the atrium.\n\nAbout the Speaker\n\nValerie J. Kuck\, worked at 
 Bell Laboratories\, Lucent Technologies in Murray Hill\, New Jersey for 34
  years. Most of her research was focused on the stabilization of polyolefi
 ns used in copper insulate\, identification and application of high temper
 ature coatings for optical fibers and the development of new devices.\n\nW
 hile at Bell Labs she became active in the North Jersey Section of the Ame
 rican Chemical Society (ACS). Shortly thereafter\, she was elected to repr
 esent the section and serve as its representative to the national organiza
 tion. Subsequently\, she was appointed or elected to chair five national c
 ommittees. She was then elected to serve nine years on the ACS Board of Di
 rectors and chaired the Board Committee on Grants and Awards.\n\nAs a comm
 ittee chair\, she instituted a number of successful efforts. Those include
 d in having more talented women appointed to national committees and propo
 sed for leadership roles in the Society so that the number of women active
  in the Society reflected their distribution in the membership. She initia
 ted procedures to substantially increase the numbers of women nominated an
 d receiving national ACS awards\, especially those based on technical acco
 mplishments. She worked to enhance the Society’s efforts in supporting t
 he unemployed by originating and presenting workshops at Local\, Regional 
 and National meetings and serving as a career consultant.\n\nThose efforts
  led her to assist in the development of workshops that were presented at 
 many universities to assist graduate students and post-docs in planning fo
 r their careers. She proposed a new event\, Sci-Mix\, which is now the mos
 t attended session held at national meetings\, to facilitate chemists in m
 eeting others with similar technical interests. Twice she organized specia
 l symposia on very late breaking scientific discoveries. With no publicity
 \, those sessions drew collectively 10\,000 national meeting attendees and
  made the national news and were covered in the popular press. She also pu
 shed for enhanced laboratory safety training in academe along with greater
  access to safe chemical handling procedures.\n\nKuck has received several
  awards from Bell Labs and three national awards from the ACS for her lead
 ership\, dedication\, and numerous efforts to help women and others in adv
 ancing their careers. She was named a distinguished alumnus by Saint-Mary-
 of-the-Woods College\, and by her graduate school\, Purdue University. She
  has authored 41 publications and has been granted 25 U.S. patents.\n\nAbo
 ut the Phillips 66 / C.J. “Pete” Silas Program in Ethics and Leadershi
 p\n\nEthics\, leadership\, and quality\, grounded in strong communication 
 skills and professionalism\, are essential components of an engineering ed
 ucation. To spotlight the importance of these core values\, in 1995 the Ph
 illips Petroleum Foundation awarded a grant to the School of Chemical & Bi
 omolecular Engineering to develop the Phillips 66/C.J. “Pete” Silas Pr
 ogram in Ethics and Leadership.\n\nNamed in recognition of the outstanding
  professional achievements of Georgia Tech chemical engineering alumnus C.
 J. “Pete” Silas\, who retired from Phillips Petroleum as chairman and 
 CEO in 1994\, the program focuses on technical and business decisions that
  have ethical ramifications. These topics and related areas in engineering
 \, technology and ethics are integrated into the core chemical and biomole
 cular engineering curriculum and are addressed in an annual public symposi
 um featuring prominent industrialists and ethicists.\n\nLinks:\n[1]  http:

 , Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\nStatus: published\n\nAbstract
 :\n\nPlaydate — a tiny\, yellow\, handheld game console — made a bigge
 r splash than its creators envisioned when it was announced this past May.
  Relying on a combination of old tech (a 1-bit black-and-white display)\, 
 new design (from Sweden’s renowned Teenage Engineering) and some just-pl
 ain-weird ideas (a side-mounted crank as a game controller)\, software mak
 er Panic Inc. hopes that Playdate can carve itself a niche in a video game
  marketplace where giants dominate. The story is still in-progress — Pla
 ydate won’t be released until next year — but Greg Maletic\, Panic’s
  Director of Special Projects\, will give you an insider’s peek at the d
 ecisions that have driven Playdate’s conception\, design\, manufacture\,
  and marketing.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\nGreg Maletic has had a varied career th
 at includes software development\, theme park design\, and consumer electr
 onics. Maletic currently is the Director of Special Projects at Panic Inc.
 \, where he leads a small team developing Playdate\, a new handheld video 
 game console shipping in 2020. Prior to Panic\, Greg worked with Walt Disn
 ey Imagineering\, developing attraction concepts and drawing illustrations
  for use in Disney theme parks. In 2007\, Maletic combined his love of fil
 m with his overwhelming interest in games and technology\, releasing the d
 ocumentary TILT: The Battle to Save Pinball. TILT chronicles the developme
 nt of “Pinball 2000”\, Bally/Williams last-ditch effort to save the dy
 ing pinball industry. Maletic’s early work experience is in software dev
 elopment and marketing\, first at Apple as a product manager for MacOS\, l
 ater as a co-founder of Zero G Software\, a software tools maker sold to M
 acrovision in 2005.\n\nSchedule of Brown Bag Speakers Fall 2019 [2]\n\nLin

 published\n\nA Frontiers in Science Lecture to celebrate 2019\, the Intern
 ational Year of the Periodic Table\nFor more than half a century\, dedicat
 ed and eager groups of scientists have contrived ways to introduce heavier
  and heavier elements into the universe. Their efforts finally completed t
 he seventh row of the famous—if poorly understood—periodic table of th
 e chemical elements.\n\nNow all 118 elements have names\, even though most
  spontaneously decay more quickly than you can say “Oganesson” or “L
 ivermorium.”\n\nWhat now? Continue? Try to start another row? Why? To wh
 at end\, and at what cost?\n\nThis talk will explore the economic\, societ
 al\, and scientific benefits and drawbacks inherent in this pursuit.\n\nAb
 out the Speaker\n\nMonica Halka [2] is an experimental physicist whose res
 earch focused on the interaction of light with atoms.\n\nShe has coauthore
 d a set of six volumes on the periodic table [3]\, which examines historic
 al\, astrophysical\, and practical observations about each of the chemical
  elements.\n\nShe serves as associate director of the Honors Program at Ge
 orgia Tech [4]\, where she teaches courses in optics\, energy science\, an
 d the nuclear age\, among others.\n\nAbout Frontiers in Science Lectures\n
 Lectures in this series are intended to inform\, engage\, and inspire stud
 ents\, faculty\, staff\, and the public on developments\, breakthroughs\, 
 and topics of general interest in the sciences and mathematics. Lecturers 
 tailor their talks for nonexpert audiences.\n\nAbout the Periodic Table Fr
 ontiers in Science Lecture Series\nThroughout 2019\, the College of Scienc

 \nAnna Liu\nPh.D. Candidate The Wallace H Coulter Department of Biomedical
  Engineering\nGeorgia Tech\n\nUltrafast Microfluidic Cell Compression for 
 Convective Intracellular Macromolecule Delivery\n\nEfficient intracellular
  delivery of target macromolecules remains a major obstacle in cell engine
 ering\, cell labeling\, and other biomedical applications. Our lab has dis
 covered the unique cell biophysical phenomenon of convective intracellular
  macromolecule delivery using mechanically induced\, transient cell volume
  exchange. Ultrafast microfluidic cell compressions are used to cause brie
 f\, deformation­induced cell volume loss followed by volume recovery thro
 ugh uptake of surrounding fluid. Macromolecules suspended in the surroundi
 ng fluid enter the cell on convective fluid currents. We harness this cell
  volume exchange behavior for high-throughput\, convective intracellular d
 elivery of large macromolecules\, including plasmids (>10 kb) and particle
 s (>30 nm)\, while maintaining high cell viability (>95%). Successful expe
 riments in transfection and intracellular labeling demonstrate potential t
 o overcome the most prohibitive challenges in intracellular delivery for c
 ell engineering.\n\nJenni Li\nUndergraduate Researcher\nGeorgia Tech\n\nIn
 vestigating Health Effects of Aerosol Particles on Single-cells in a High-
 throughput Air-liquid Interface Platform\n\nAir pollution and its detrimen
 tal health effects have been an increasingly alarming concern for the worl
 d. Cardiovascular diseases\, chronic respiratory diseases\, and different 
 types of cancers can all be linked to air pollution effects. Furthermore\,
  over 4 million people die per year from the direct effects of ambient par
 ticulate matter. One conventional method for studying the health effects o
 f aerosol particles is to collect particulate matter (PM) from the atmosph
 ere\, resuspend the PM in cell culture media\, add the PM/media to cell cu
 ltures\, and assess single cell oxidative stress. However\, this method do
 es not resemble the in vivo conditions of alveolar macrophages. Alveolar m
 acrophages are found in the alveoli of the lungs where the oxygen and carb
 on dioxide exchange between blood and air takes place and are a key cell t
 ype that is affected by PM. In this project\, we aim to create a microflui
 dic air-liquid interface environment that mimics how alveolar macrophages 
 are exposed to PM in order to study effects of PM at a single-cell level. 
 Utilizing a microfluidic platform provides uniform microenvironment and en
 ables high-throughput and high content single-cell analysis for hundreds o
 f cells. We adapted a previously developed microfluidic single-cell analys
 is technology and developed a method for exposing cells to an air-liquid i
 nterface. We then characterized cells by microscopy and LIVE/DEAD staining
  to assess if cells remain viable during air exposure. Following this vali
 dation of the air-liquid interface platform\, we will use it to study the 
 single cell responses of intracellular reactive oxygen species in exposure
  to aerosol particles.\n\nLinks:\n[1]  http://hg.gatech.edu/node/625922#0\

 h-dimensional single-cell analysis has become critical to basic and clinic
 al research. In traditional flow cytometry\, the spectral overlap between 
 fluorophores requires complicated data compensation and limits the number 
 of markers measured\, thus creating speed\, labor and reproducibility bott
 lenecks. Mass Cytometry overcomes these limitations by utilizing antibodie
 s labelled with rare earth metals. 2019 has been the most active year yet 
 in the mass cytometry community with over 200 publications to date. CyTOF
 ® technology has also been adopted by multiple consortia and in more than
  40 clinical trials.\nThe Helios™\, a CyTOF® system permits the analysi
 s of 37+ unique targets on a per-cell basis enabling unparalleled insight 
 into the phenotype and function of cell populations from normal and diseas
 ed states in a single tube. Additionally\, barcoding for Mass Cytometry al
 lows combining up to 20 samples in one tube for increased efficiency and t
 o eliminate sample to sample variation.\nIn this seminar\, we will describ
 e the workflow for the Helios™ system\, how to get started with your own
  mass cytometry experiments\, and the resources that are available to you 
 to ensure your success.\n\nQuantitative Single Cell Dissection of Tumor Mi

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\nStatus: published\n\nInstitu
 te Diversity\, in collaboration with the Office of the Vice Provost for Gr
 aduate Education and Faculty Development and Georgia Tech’s ADVANCE Prog
 ram\, is offering four 90-minute Implicit Bias Workshops for faculty this 
 fall on August 29\, September 6\, September 17\, and September 27. All fac
 ulty who serve on reappointment\, promotion\, and/or tenure committees and
  faculty search committees are required to participate in an Implicit Bias
  Workshop pursuant to Provost Bras’ memo in October 2016 to academic lea
 ders. However\, all instructional and research faculty are welcomed to att
 end as space permits.\n\nThe goals of these workshops are to increase awar
 eness of the impact of implicit bias and facilitate equitable decision-mak
 ing across myriad processes related to faculty evaluations. As a participa
 nt in the workshop\, you will learn the following:\n\n• An introduction 
 to the concept of implicit bias and how these unconscious\, automatic ment
 al processes may impact behaviors such as evaluating candidates during fac
 ulty search and/or RPT processes.\n\n• Empirical research on vitaes\, le
 tters of recommendations\, and teaching evaluations to illustrate the impa
 ct of implicit bias on decisions.\n\n• Effective practices and strategie
 s for faculty search and RPT committees.\n\nThese workshops will be facili
 tated by Julie Ancis\, associate vice president\, Institute Diversity\; Pa
 ul Benkeser\, senior associate chair and professor\, Wallace H. Coulter De
 partment of Biomedical Engineering\; Harris Dimitropoulos\, associate prof
 essor\, School of Architecture\; Robert Kirkman\, associate professor\, Sc
 hool of Public Policy\; Mark Mitchell\, associate director\, Georgia Tech 
 Research Institute\; and/or Michelle Rinehart\, associate dean for academi

 \nThe Machine Learning Center at Georgia Tech invites you to a seminar by 
 Chandrajit Bajaj from the University of Texas.\n\nTITLE\nLearning the Koop
 man Operator for Dynamic Data\n\nABSTRACT\n\nRecent work in the study of d
 ynamic systems has focussed on data-driven decomposition techniques that a
 pproximate the action of the Koopman operator on observable functions of t
 he underlying phenomena.\n\nIn particular\, the data-driven method of dyna
 mic mode decomposition (DMD) has been explored\, with multiple variants of
  the algorithm in existence\, including extended DMD\, DMD in reproducing 
 kernel Hilbert spaces\, a Bayesian framework\, a variant for stochastic dy
 namical systems\, and a variant that uses deep neural networks.\n\nIn this
  talk\, I shall briefly summarize the large existing work on data-driven l
 earning of Koopman operator models\, and then describe new sampling-based 
 sketching approaches (SketchyCoreSVD\, SketchyCoreTucker) together with ma
 trix-valued Kernels\, to achieve accelerated Koopman operator approximatio
 ns of dynamic observable data. Examples are drawn from remote sensing and 
 FTIR hyperspectral tensor images\, bio-medical cardiac magnetic resonance 
 video\, and time series reactive flow simulations of a single ejector comb
 ustion process.\n\nBIO\nChandrajit Bajaj is the Computational Applied Math
 ematics Chair in Visualization\, professor of computer science\, and direc
 tor of the Center for Computational Visualization at the University of Tex
 as at Austin. Bajaj earned his undergraduate degree in electrical engineer
 ing from the Indian Institute of Technology\, and his master's and Ph.D. i
 n computer science from Cornell University. He is an IEEE\, ACM\, and AAAS
  Fellow\, and has won numerous best paper awards throughout his career. Ba
 jaj has also served as the editor of various publications including ACM Co
 mputing Survey\, SIAM Journal on Imaging Sciences\, and the International 
 Journal of Computational Geometry and Applications. He has authored severa
 l books [2].\n\nLinks:\n[1]  http://hg.gatech.edu/node/622930#0\n[2]  http

 Atlanta\, GA 30332\n\nThis workshop\, co-developed by Citrine Informatics1
  and the Institute for Materials at Georgia Tech2\, seeks to provide basic
  skills in data analysis and machine learning for materials scientists and
  engineers. The pace of the course is such that students from academia and
  industry with minimal experience in computation will be able to benefit.\
 n\nDay 1 of the course will introduce a variety of open-source web tools f
 or extracting and analyzing materials data. Day 2 of the course will intro
 duce programmatic techniques for materials data analysis. The goal is to i

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Public\
 , Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\nStatus: published\n\nAbstract
 :\n\nDr. Berns will discuss how the domestic dog’s accessibility\, socia
 l intelligence\, and co-evolutionary history with humans provides a unique
  opportunity to study homologous brain function in a naturalistic way that
  cannot be done with any other species. Dr. Berns will show how dogs can b
 e trained to cooperatively participate in fMRI studies – without restrai
 nt or anesthesia – and how this has opened up a wealth of new data about
  canine brain function. These results have identified the circuitry of pot
 entially homologous functions ranging from reward and face processing to r
 udiments of language perception. And because dogs live with humans\, they 
 offer a unique opportunity to study the neurobiology of inter-species soci
 al cognition. Machine-learning approaches can be used to “decode” the 
 dog brain. Finally\, because the dogs participate in repeated scan session
 s over their lifetimes\, the project has created a unique longitudinal coh
 ort\, which\, in some cases has allowed the detection of CNS tumors before
  symptoms appear and the monitoring of tumor regression following radiatio
 n treatment.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\nDr. Berns is the Distinguished Professor o
 f Neuroeconomics and Psychology at Emory University\, where he directs the
  Facility for Education & Research in Neuroscience. Trained as a biomedica
 l engineer\, he was also a practicing psychiatrist in the Department of Ps
 ychiatry at Emory University and was one of the founding members of the fi
 eld of neuroeconomics\, using fMRI to study mechanisms of decision-making 
 in humans. In 2011\, he launched an effort to train dogs to cooperatively 
 participate in fMRI studies\, resulting in the first demonstration of its 
 feasibility. Since then\, he has trained and scanned 100 dogs on a wide va
 riety of cognitive paradigms.\n\nSchedule of Brown Bag Speakers Fall 2019

 \nProf. Blair Brettmann - School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering\
 , School of Materials Science and Engineering\, Georgia Institute of Techn
 ology\nAbstract: Electrospinning is a valuable production method for nanos
 cale polymeric fibers. However\, a major limitation of the technology is t
 he requirement for the use of high molecular weight polymers as a major pa
 rt of the matrix. Many applications would benefit from a more expansive ra
 nge in the materials able to be electrospun\, including pharmaceuticals\, 
 wearable devices and diagnostics\, and active filtration. In order to real
 ize these more advanced functional materials\, composites of polymers and 
 particles must be developed and a strong understanding of how particle inc
 lusion affects the electrospinning process and mat properties is essential
 . In this work\, we examine material systems containing various polymers a
 nd active particles\, focusing on how inclusion of particles affects elect
 rospinnability and functionality of the fibrous mat. We have found that po
 lymer solutions with high conductivity\, hence narrow fiber diameters\, te
 nd to trap particles in a web-like structure\, rather than within individu
 al fibers. Other polymer-particle systems exhibit a ‘bunches of grapes
 ’ morphology where the particles agglomerate yet the polymer matrix stil
 l surrounds them and connects the bunches with fibers. These interesting m
 orphologies can be explained by conductivity\, rheology\, and particle int
 eractions in the polymer solution. We also examine how particle inclusion 
 affects the viscoelasticity of the solutions and tie this to the electrosp
 inning process window\; showing that a finite window of viscoelasticity yi
 elds optimal electrospinnability. We use these fundamental results to elec
 trospin materials for advanced functional applications such as pharmaceuti
 cals and conducting polymers and provide outlook for further work in incre
 asing the range of materials that are electrospinnable.\n\nBio: Blair Bret

 t\n\nThe Alliance for the Development of Additive Processing Technologies 
 (ADAPT) is developing a combined physics – machine learning platform for
  assessing Process-Structure-Property relationships in metals additive man
 ufacturing. An added benefit of this approach is the inherent statistical 
 core of the models – the AI platform is not only capable of learning the
  PSP relations of AM\, but also providing statistical reports on part qual
 ity and variation in a manner conducive to certification. In this presenta
 tion\, it will be shown how such a framework can be used to optimize parts
 \, processes\, and materials for metals additive manufacturing\, resulting
  in reduced times and costs for qualifications. The parts example will cov
 er accelerated qualification of a 17-4 Stainless Steel door hinge for an A
 rmy ground vehicle. The materials example will document ways and means to 
 make laser powder bed fusion manufactured Inconel 718 stronger & more duct
 ile than wrought material. The processes example will show how machine lea
 rning can be used to determine the parameters for a new printer that has a
  more powerful laser than previous generations of machines\, with verifica
 tion carried out in printing Ti-64 coupons. These examples will be motivat
 ed with a vision for how networks of 3D printers that share a common datab
 ase can shift paradigms in manufacturing.\n\nBiography\n\nAaron is the Row

 egion on Australia’s east coast is home to the world’s largest coal ex
 port operation. More tons of coal are exported each year from the port of 
 Newcastle\, at the mouth of the Hunter River\, than from any other port in
  the world. Coal exported is mined by more than 10 competing producers ope
 rating upward of 40 mines\, but uses shared infrastructure to reach the po
 rt\, be blended into final products held in stockyards and loaded onto ves
 sels at berth. The shared infrastructure\, which consists of rail lines\, 
 trains\, stockyards\, stockpile stacking and reclaiming machinery\, berths
 \, vessel loading machinery\, the river channel and tug boats\, is owned a
 nd/or operated by several different organizations. All of these organizati
 ons must coordinate their activities so as to deliver coal in an effective
  and efficient way. In this talk\, we will discuss how collaboration betwe
 en the many stakeholders has been shaped and evolved\, how collaboration h
 as been essential to the delivery of productivity gains in this complex lo
 gistics system\, and will touch on the critical role analytics and the too
 ls of operations research have played.​\n\nSESSION SPEAKER\n\nNatashia B

  is interested in the natural electricity of the Earth\, including lightni
 ng\, the electrically charged upper atmosphere\, and the radiation-filled 
 space environment. He uses radio waves at low frequencies measured all aro
 und the world to understand them\, and develops resulting practical applic
 ations. His group also works on novel techniques to generate low frequency
  waves with nonconventional electrically-short antennas. He is an author o
 f more than 60 journal publications. He employs a “flipped classroom” 
 model in some of his courses to make the experience more active and engagi
 ng.\n\nHe enjoys hiking\, cooking\, traveling\, and building pizza ovens.\

 , Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\nStatus: published\n\nAbstract
 :\n\nWhen we think about technology mediating human interactions with data
 \, we often think about how it improves the practices of people’s usual 
 activities\, from making them more mindful of their daily movements throug
 h step-tracking devices\, to improving capabilities to make informed busin
 ess decisions using data-rich analytics in a digital dashboard. This talk 
 explores how technologies can expand people to look beyond what they usual
 ly do: how can a zoomable interface spark wonder about aquatic insects to 
 engage non-scientists in water quality monitoring\, and how can a touchscr
 een inspire new questions about familiar objects to foster cross-cultural 
 dialogues? I will present multiple projects integrating interactive techno
 logies as mediators of informal\, social learning and argue for the import
 ance of technology’s role in provoking empathy\, curiosity\, and engagem
 ent to drive and expand interest in unfamiliar domains.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\
 nJessica Roberts is an assistant professor in the School of Interactive Co
 mputing at Georgia Tech. She holds a PhD in Learning Sciences from the Uni
 versity of Illinois-Chicago with a concentration in geospatial analysis an
 d visualization and a B.S. from Northwestern University with a concentrati
 on in theatre design. Her research examines how people learn through\, wit
 h\, and about data in out-of-school environments such as museums and citiz
 en science activities and how interactive technologies mediate social\, in
 formal learning experiences. Her work on the design of interactive learnin
 g technologies has won paper awards at CSCL and CHI\, and her projects hav
 e been exhibited at venues including the Field Museum of Natural History i
 n Chicago and the New York Hall of Science.\n\nSchedule of Brown Bag Speak

 e served customers operating in a wide variety of harsh environments—fro
 m deep ocean basins to outer space. Huff began his career working for offs
 hore drilling companies after graduating from Georgia Tech. This experienc
 e\, and his penchant for adventure\, eventually led him to became presiden
 t and CEO of Oceaneering\, which he transformed from a small offshore oil 
 and diving company into a highly successful multinational corporation. Huf
 f achieved this by tying oil exploration with deep sea exploration. In add
 ition to many other achievements\, the company developed the remote-operat
 ed vehicles that assisted in the exploration of the Titanic\, the wreckage
  of the Challenger capsule\, and the remains of the H.L. Hunley\, a Civil

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Public\
 , Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\nStatus: published\n\nAbstract
 :\n\nMorphing matter harnesses the programmability in material structures 
 and compositions to achieve transformative behaviors and integrates sensin
 g\, actuation\, and computation to create adaptive and responsive material
  systems. These material systems can be leveraged to design soft robots\, 
 self-assembling furniture\, adaptive fabrics\, and self-folding foods. In 
 this talk\, Lining presents the recent works in the Morphing Matter Lab\, 
 Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University and hig
 hlights several robotic morphing materials that weave advanced manufacturi
 ng with computational tools. Her team believes that the term “robotics
 ” does not only refer to conventional robotic forms and controls but als
 o connects to the artifacts’ ability to make decisions\, adapt\, move\, 
 and respond to different stimuli. More information from the lab site: http
 s://morphingmatter.cs.cmu.edu/.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\nLining Yao is an Assist
 ant Professor of Human-Computer Interaction Institute (HCII) at Carnegie M
 ellon University\, School of Computer Science\, directing the Morphing Mat
 ter Lab. Morphing Matter lab develops materials\, tools\, and applications
  of adaptive\, dynamic and intelligent morphing matter from nano to macro 
 scales. Research often combines material science\, computational fabricati
 on and creative design practices. Lining and her lab work anti-disciplinar
 ily\, publishing and exhibiting across science\, engineering\, design and 
 art. Lining gained her PhD at MIT Media Lab\, where she combined biologica
 l and engineering approaches to develop physical materials with dynamic an
 d tunable properties including shape\, color\, stiffness\, texture and den
 sity. Beyond her teaching and research in the School of Computer Science\,
  Lining holds courtesy appointments at Mechanical Engineering\, as well as
  Material Sciences and Engineering. She is supervising undergraduate and g
 raduate students across the College of Engineering and College of Art.\n\n

 \nSeth Marder\nRegents Professor\; Georgia Power Chair of Energy Efficienc
 y\nSchool of Chemistry & Biochemistry\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n\n
 Abstract: Organic\, hybrid\, and 2D materials have attracted interest for 
 electronic applications due to their potential for use in low-cost\, large
 -area\, flexible electronic devices. Here we will report on recent develop
 ments pertaining to surface modifiers and dopants that could impact the ch
 arge injection/collection/transport processes in organic light emitting di
 odes\, organic field effect transistors\, and photovoltaic devices. In par
 ticular\, we will examine how N-heterocylic carbenes assemble on gold subs
 trates\, the impact of the surface dipole on the work function of the gold
 . We will also discuss the development of metallocenes-based dimers as n-d
 opants and very briefly describe metal dithiolene complexes as p-dopants f
 or organic semiconductors and their impact of device performance.\n\nBio: 
 Seth Marder is currently the Georgia Power Chair of Energy Efficiency and

 :\n\nDigital technologies have increasingly begun to permeate the driving 
 experience in recent years to support continually increasing information a
 nd cognitive needs associated with driving and non-driving activities in t
 he car. With recent pilot projects like Waymo\, Uber\, and Tesla\, we can 
 anticipate that autonomous driving technology will have a significant impa
 ct on accelerating the transformation of automobile interface in its more 
 than one hundred years long history. As the technology matures\, and initi
 al public enthusiasm wanes\, designing a better user experience within thi
 s new mode of travel will be of critical importance for our future. In thi
 s talk\, we examined the user experience issues that will arise with the i
 ntroduction of autonomous driving including the attention-activity changes
  and related design considerations. We then discuss current disciplinary-s
 pecific design methodologies and introduce a more comprehensive approach t
 o the design space to optimize the opportunities for user interaction with
  examples to meet the changes in the vehicle and the associated transporta
 tion service.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\nAs an assistant professor\, Dr. Wei Wang 
 brings industrial and international experience to the Industrial Design pr
 ogram at Georgia Institute of Technology. His research interests stand in 
 the interactive technology\, human-computer interaction and smart product 
 design from user experience perspective. He is directing DesigNext lab in 
 School of Industrial Design on the applications of emerging interface desi
 gn in future consumer electronics. His patents in gesture interaction and 
 mobile service have been applied widely in consumer products by Nokia and 
 Microsoft. Wang won multiply international awards\, included the Annual En
 gagement and Enterprise Awards from Queen Mary University of London (UK)\,
  Annual Achievement Awards from Nokia (Finland)\, the Science and Technolo
 gy Award of China Mechanical Industry (China)\, and the Michelin Challenge
  Design Award in the worldwide. Wang used to work in Nokia Research Center
 \, Hunan University and Queen Mary University of London before he joined G
 eorgia Tech in 2016. Wang is a member of IDSA and ACM SIGCHI\, and receive
 d his Ph.D. in design in 2008.\n\nSchedule of Brown Bag Speakers Fall 2019

 \nTITLE: Edge Computing: A New Disruptive Force\n\nABSTRACT:\n\nAt the hei
 ght of its success\, cloud computing is yielding to edge computing. Why is
  this happening? What is the unique value proposition of edge computing? A
 s real-world deployments of edge computing appear\, how will the lives of 
 end users be improved? What new applications and capabilities will they se
 e? Which applications run best at the edge\, which run best in the cloud\,
  and which should straddle the edge and cloud? How do we build systems tha
 t are seamless to the user but leverage all the available tiers of computi
 ng to best effect? Based on my team’s decade-long exploration of edge co
 mputing\, I will share my insights on these questions. Of particular inter
 est is a new class of “wearable cognitive assistance” applications tha
 t lie at the convergence of edge computing\, wearable devices\, and cognit
 ive algorithms (e.g. computer vision\, speech recognition\, natural langua
 ge processing). Drawing upon insights from these edge-native applications\

 ed on the challenges of performance\, scalability\, availability\, and tru
 st in information systems that reach from the cloud to the mobile edge of 
 the internet. In the course of this work\, he has pioneered many advances 
 in distributed systems\, mobile computing\, pervasive computing\, and the 
 internet of things (IoT). As described in How we created edge computing\, 
 Satya’s seminal 2009 publication The Case for VM-based Cloudlets in Mobi

 e\, this land in the heart of the North Georgia is the perfect getaway for
  the busy Georgia Tech student. Our trip includes an afternoon exploring t
 he charming town of Chattanooga\, two days of taking in the views through 
 scenic day hikes\, followed by a day of service work to support keeping th
 e State Park beautiful and accessible for all visitors.\n\nAlongside a par
 k ranger\, our work may involve building needed trail infrastructure\, mai
 ntaining existing trails\, and removing damaging invasive species. Trails 
 we will hike will take around the canyon rims exposing panoramic views of 
 forested mountains\, scenic rivers and waterfalls\, and will be accessible
  to all skill levels. In addition to hiking and trail service\, there will
  be ample opportunity for stargazing\, campfire songs\, getting to know yo
 ur fellow Tech students\, and unwinding from the hustle and bustle of scho
 ol.\n\nThis is a great alternative break option which includes important a

 \, Public\, Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\, freebies\nStatus: 
 published\n\nA Frontiers in Science Lecture to celebrate 2019\, the Intern
 ational Year of the Periodic Table\nThe Cold War rivalry between the Unite
 d States and the Soviet Union lasted for much of the second half of the 20
 th century. While the superpowers never engaged directly in full-scale arm
 ed combat\, a nuclear arms race became the centerpiece of a doctrine of mu
 tually assured destruction\, and prompted a mass production of plutonium\,
  and the designing\, building\, and testing of large numbers of nuclear we
 apons.\n\nIn more than 50 years of operation\, the Cold War battlefields c
 reated over 100 metric tons of plutonium\, produced tens of thousands of n
 uclear warheads\, oversaw more than 1000 detonations\, and left behind a l
 egacy of contaminated facilities\, soils\, and ground water.\n\nThe extent
  of long-term adverse health effects will depend on the mobility of pluton
 ium and other actinides in the environment and on our ability to develop c
 ost-effective scientific methods of removing or isolating actinides from t
 he environment. Studying the complex chemistry of plutonium and the actini
 des in the environment is one of the most important technological challeng
 es\, and one of the greatest scientific challenges in actinide science tod
 ay.\n\nDavid L. Clark will summarize our current understanding of actinide
  chemistry in the environment\, and how that understanding was used in the
  decontamination and decommissioning of the Rocky Flats Site\, where pluto
 nium triggers for U.S. nuclear weapons were manufactured. At Rocky Flats\,
  synchrotron radiation measurements made at the Stanford Synchrotron Radia
 tion Laboratory were developed into a science-based decision-making tool t
 hat saved billions of dollars by focusing site-directed efforts in the cor
 rect areas\, and aided the most extensive cleanup in the history of Superf
 und legislation to finish one year ahead of schedule\, ultimately resultin
 g in billions of dollars in taxpayer savings. (LA-UR-15-22406)\n\nAbout th
 e Speaker\n\nDavid L. Clark [2] is a Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL)
  Fellow and Director of the Laboratory’s National Security Education Cen
 ter. He received a B.S. in chemistry in 1982 from the University of Washin
 gton\, and a Ph.D. in 1986 from Indiana University.\n\nClark was a postdoc
 toral fellow at the University of Oxford before joining Los Alamos Nationa
 l Laboratory as a J. Robert Oppenheimer Fellow in 1988. He became a Techni
 cal Staff Member in the Isotope and Nuclear Chemistry Division in 1989. Si
 nce then he has held various leadership positions at Los Alamos\, includin
 g PI for the Laboratory’s BES Heavy Element Chemistry program (1993 – 
 2014)\, Solubility Task for the Yucca Mountain Project (1993-1997)\, Sourc
 e Term Test Program for the WIPP license application (1996-1997)\, program
  manager for plutonium aging and pit lifetime assessments\, (1998-2003)\, 
 and Capture Manager for the Plutonium Science and Research Strategy (2009 
 – 2019).\n\nClark has been highly involved in service to the actinide ch
 emistry community through organization of ACS symposia (1993-present)\, se
 rvice on organizing and steering committees of 3 international actinide co
 nferences including Actinides (1993-present)\, Migration (2003 – present
 )\, and Plutonium Futures – the Science (1997-present)\; the establishme
 nt and stewardship of the Seaborg Institute at Los Alamos (1997-2009)\; th
 e development of the Plutonium Science and Research Strategy (2009-present
 )\; and much more.\n\nHe has served the DOE as a technical advisor for env
 ironmental stewardship including the Rocky Flats cleanup and closure (1995
 -2005)\, closure of High-Level Waste tanks at the Savannah River Site (201
 1)\, and as a technical advisor to the DOE High Level Waste Corporate Boar
 d (2009-2011).\n\nHe is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advan
 cement of Science\, and a Los Alamos Laboratory Fellow. He is the recipien
 t of two ACS national awards - the Nobel Laureate Signature Award (1988) a
 nd the Glenn Seaborg Award in Nuclear Chemistry (2017). He has also been h
 onored with several Defense Programs Awards of Excellence\, the most notab
 le in 2006 for his work on pit lifetime assessments for the nation.\n\nHis
  research interests are in the molecular and electronic structure of actin
 ide materials\, applications of synchrotron radiation to nuclear security\
 , behavior of actinide and fission products in the environment\, the aging
  effects of nuclear weapons materials\, and the education of judges on the
  methods of science.\n\nHe is an international authority on the chemistry 
 and physics of the actinides\, and has published over 175 peer-reviewed pu
 blications\, encyclopedia and book chapters.\n\nAbout Frontiers in Science

 etit Distinguished Lecture by Wendell Lim\, University of California\, San
  Francisco\n\nThe eras of molecular biology and genomics have given us an 
 unprecedented picture of the molecular components underlying living system
 s. Nonetheless\, our understanding of how these components are assembled t
 o generate precision physiological systems remains far less developed.\n\n
 To approach this problem\, we and others have been using synthetic biology
  methods to empirically explore how molecular components can be used to co
 nstruct novel cellular functions. Using these approaches\, we have shown t
 hat we can reprogram living cellular machines that carry out new precision
  functions\, including therapeutic immune cells that precisely recognize a
 nd eliminate cancer cells\, or cells that self-organize into tissues.\n\nB
 y merging our understanding of cellular machines with our knowledge of our
  bodies and its diseases\, we envision the development of a mature field o
 f cell engineering with a toolbox of optimized molecular parts and circuit
  architectures\, as well as disease and "GPS" sensors that allow the cell 
 to target specific sites in the body or brain.\n\nSuch a platform will all
 ow us to rapidly and flexibly prototype and design cells that can identify
  sites of disease or degeneration and execute precisely targeted and contr
 olled therapeutic actions.\n\nAbout the Speaker\nWendell Lim is the Byers 
 Distinguished Professor and Chair of the Department of Cellular and Molecu
 lar Pharmacology at the University of California\, San Francisco. He is an
  Investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.\n\nHe received his A
 .B. in Chemistry\, summa cum laude\, from Harvard College and his Ph.D. in
  Biochemistry and Biophysics from he Massachusetts Institute of Technology
 . He completed postdoctoral training at Yale University.\n\nHis research f
 ocuses on the design principles of molecular circuits that govern cell dec
 ision-making and responses. His lab has made contributions in understandin
 g the molecular machinery of cell signaling and how molecular modules have
  been used in evolution to build novel new behaviors.\n\nMost recently he 
 has been a pioneer in the emerging field of synthetic biology\, exploring 
 how these design principles can be harnessed to engineer cells with custom
 ized therapeutic response programs. He is an author of the textbook "Cell 
 Signaling" (Garland Science 2014) and was the founder of the cell therapy

 \nLecture Topic | Planning Sustainably: An Infrastructure-based Approach\n
 \nThe lecture will address the sustainability of infrastructure and the En
 vision® rating system\, developed at Harvard University. Then\, sustainab
 le infrastructure will be introduced as the starting point and a prerequis
 ite for sustainable cities and an inextricable part of urban planning and 
 configuration. The proposed systems approach emphasizes the synergies and 
 interconnections between infrastructure processes\, including physical str
 uctures and operations\, natural processes\, and the end-user. Each system
  is decoded\, addressing (a) the main demand or consumption that must be c
 overed by the system\, (b) the strategic approach and resources to meet th
 e demand\, and (c) the facilities and networks required. When a system is 
 relevant to the needs or performance of another system\, the connection is
  highlighted supporting the development of multifaceted\, integrated plans
 .\n\nAbout Professor Spiro Pollalis\n\nSpiro Pollalis\, a Harvard Universi
 ty professor of 34 years\, is an expert in the sustainability of infrastru
 cture and cities. At Harvard\, he has developed the Envision® sustainabil
 ity rating system.\n\nProfessor Pollalis consults governments and the priv
 ate sector on sustainability\, and he is the chief planner for several sus
 tainable cities\, including a new city in Pakistan for 600\,000 people\, n
 ow under construction.\n\nProfessor Pollalis collaborates on sustainabilit
 y with the World Bank\, the Inter-American Development Bank\, IFC\, the Un
 ited Nations\, and the World Wide Fund For Nature (WWF).\n\nProf. Pollalis

 \, Public\, Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\, freebies\nStatus: 
 published\n\nA Frontiers in Science Lecture to celebrate 2019\, the Intern
 ational Year of the Periodic Table\nIn 1997\, the Japanese oceanographer Y
 oshiyuki Nozaki compiled a periodic table of ocean chemistry [2]\, encapsu
 lating the distribution of elements as a function of depth. In this period
 ic table\, many elements share similar patterns\, classified into just a f
 ew categories. The similarities indicate a common set of mechanisms behind
  the ocean cycling of elements.\n\nThe interaction of ocean circulation\, 
 chemistry\, and biology sets the distribution of elements in the ocean. Fo
 r example\, nonreactive elements are nearly uniformly distributed in the w
 ater column\, homogenized by ocean circulation and mixing.\n\nNutrient ele
 ments are depleted near the surface because of biological consumption and 
 enriched in mid-depth due to decomposition of organic matter. Some trace m
 etals – such as Fe\, Zn\, Ni\, and Cd – follow this pattern. In contra
 st\, some heavy metals – like Al\, Mn\, Co\, and Pb – are subsumed int
 o particles and removed from seawater.\n\nBuilding on the insights from No
 zaki’s periodic table\, this talk will interpret recent measurements of 
 changing seawater chemistry\, highlighting the importance of rising carbon
  dioxide concentration in the air\, climate change\, and pollution of rive
 rs and atmosphere.\n\nAbout the Speaker\nTakamitsu “Taka” Ito [3] is a
 n associate professor in the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences\, wh
 ere he teaches physical and chemical oceanography. He received a Ph.D. in 
 Earth\, Atmospheric\, and Planetary Sciences in 2005 from Massachusetts In
 stitute of Technology. His research has focused on the cycling of carbon\,
  oxygen\, and iron in the global oceans\, using observations\, theory\, an
 d computational modeling.\n\nAbout Frontiers in Science Lectures\nLectures
  in this series are intended to inform\, engage\, and inspire students\, f
 aculty\, staff\, and the public on developments\, breakthroughs\, and topi
 cs of general interest in the sciences and mathematics. Lecturers tailor t
 heir talks for nonexpert audiences.\n\nAbout the Periodic Table Frontiers 
 in Science Lecture Series\nThroughout 2019\, the College of Sciences will 
 bring prominent researchers from Georgia Tech and beyond to expound on lit
 tle-discussed aspects of chemical elements:\n\n- Feb. 6\, James Sowell\, H
 ow the Universe Made the Elements in the Periodic Table\n- March 5\, Micha

 \nTITLE: Software Testing: And the Challenges (and Opportunities) Keep Com
 ing!\n\nABSTRACT:\n\nDisruptive shifts in software application types and s
 oftware development environments create challenges to software testing tha
 t need to be addressed to ensure software quality and reduce the cost of s
 oftware development time. Over the years\, the size and complexity of soft
 ware have grown as well as the need for fast-changing codebases\, fault de
 tection strategies\, and test case generation and selection. To meet these
  challenges\, techniques such as regression testing\, selection/prioritiza
 tion\, and fault localization have been developed as well as specialized t
 esting techniques for GUIs\, object-oriented software\, mobile computing\,
  and continuous evolution of software to name a few. This talk presents an
  overview of these challenges and solutions and references Mary Jean Harro
 ld’s achievements in these areas. The talk then explores current challen
 ges and opportunities that bring problems that cannot be solved by state o
 f art techniques\, including applications that are machine learning applic
 ations or use machine learning as part of a system where components intera
 ct and evolve. Other challenges that need to be explored involve autonomou
 s systems\, cloud applications\, and data churn. As software becomes more 
 autonomous\, its operations and outputs become less predictable at test wr
 iting time\; hence\, the traditional nature of assert (Actual\, Expected) 
 test oracles does not work and needs to be addressed.\n\nBIO:\n\nMary Lou 
 Soffa is the Owen R. Cheatham Professor of Sciences in the Computer Scienc
 e Department at the University of Virginia\, serving as the department cha
 ir from 2004 to 2012. Her research interests include software testing\, pr
 ogram analysis\, warehouse scale computing\, software systems for multi-co
 re architectures\, and optimizing compilers. She has published over 175 ar
 ticles and has directed 32 Ph.D. students to completion\, half of whom are
  women and including Mary Jean Harrold. Soffa is an ACM and IEEE Fellow. O
 ther notable awards include the Ken Kennedy Award for contributions to com
 piler technology\, the IEEE Software Engineering Women in Science and Engi
 neering Leadership Award\, and the Anita Borg Technical Leadership Award. 
 For her career-long dedication to diversity in computing\, she received th
 e Presidential Award for Excellence in Science\, Mathematics and Engineeri
 ng Mentoring and Computing Research Association (CRA) Nico Habermann Award
 . She has served as conference chair\, program chair\, or program committe
 e member for conferences in programming languages\, architecture\, and sof
 tware engineering. She served on the ACM Publications Board and on the Com
 puter Research Association Board (CRA). She co-founded the CRA-W Graduate 
 Cohort for Women\, the Cohort for Associate Professors and the Grad Cohort
  for Underrepresented Minorities and Persons with Disabilities.\n\nLinks:\

 livery\nDon Ratliff [2]\, Regents' Professor Emeritus and Co-Executive Dir
 ector\, Georgia Tech Panama Logistics Innovation & Research Center\n\nLast
 -mile delivery (i.e.\, the delivery of merchandise to a store or end user)
 \, is a prime target for digital transformation. It is the most expensive 
 and fastest growing leg of the supply chain and often the most critical to
  customer satisfaction. Unfortunately\, it is also the most complex leg of
  the supply chain. We will discuss the delivery characteristics and trends
  that make digital transformation a necessity. We will also discuss the fi
 ve stages of digital transformation necessary to optimize delivery systems
 : 1. Data digitization\; 2. Business intelligence\; 3. Predictive analytic
 s\; 4. Automated delivery planning\; and Adaptive management. Finally\, we
  will examine the advances in technology that enable transformation of las
 t-mile delivery.\n\nRegister Online for upcoming SCL IRC seminars [3]\n\nA
 ttendance to the sessions is complimentary for SCL corporate partners\, SC
 L Industry Advisory Board members\, SCL affiliated faculty and students\, 
 and students enrolled in the Masters in Supply Chain Engineering program.\

 \nSung Jin Park\nAssistant Professor\, Coulter Department of Biomedical En

 id System Laboratory\, is interested in elucidating how biological systems
  coordinate the hierarchical structures and functions of their individual 
 components\, in order to produce emergent physical behaviors\, and how dis
 rupting this coordination potentiates disease. We seek to design\, build\,
  and test a hierarchy of biohybrid systems capable of reproducing the targ
 eted behaviors. Our primary interest is coordinated activation and contrac
 tion of tissue- and organ-level cardiac and skeletal muscle systems. To pu
 rsue this goal\, we focus on the development of biohybrid fabrication meth
 ods and measurement systems through the combined application of genetic to
 ols\, induced pluripotent stem cells\, tissue engineering\, microfabricati
 on\, electronics\, optics\, and feedback control. The resulting findings a
 nd technical developments will be translated into various applications suc
 h as (1) stem cell-based functional assays for personalized disease diagno
 sis and treatment and (2) new types of biohybrid actuators for creating bi
 ological autonomous systems.\n\nLinks:\n[1]  http://hg.gatech.edu/node/622

  (UAM) with electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft is emer
 ging as a promising aviation market for both cargo delivery and passenger 
 travel. The rise of UAM is being driven by the convergence of two technolo
 gies: autonomy and electric aircraft propulsion. Although promising\, thes
 e technologies place limits on the discovery of viable markets\, the timel
 ine of introduction\, and the design of operational paradigms. In particul
 ar\, electric propulsion—when achieved with battery energy storage—is 
 highly constraining in terms of aircraft payload\, range\, and speed perfo
 rmance and in terms of operational tempo and ground infrastructure. This t
 alk will discuss recent work in modeling aircraft performance and operatio
 ns for UAM and will highlight the challenges and opportunities in particul
 ar urban markets.\n\nSESSION SPEAKER\n\nBrian German [2]\, Daniel Guggenhe
