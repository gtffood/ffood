 \nThe topic for the first Deep Startups of the Fall 2019 semester is Music
  Technology featuring Shachar Oren\, previous Peloton executive for music 
 innovation.\n\nShachar Oren is a thought leader in music business and tech
 nology and founder of the company\, Neurotic Media\, which he grew to bein
 g a leading force in music distribution for all the major music labels. In
  2018\, he sold the company to Peloton and served as VP of Music in charge
  of music innovation for a year. Shachar stepped down from Peloton in May 
 and has been advising TechStars and ATDC companies and while also serving 
 as volunteer President of Georgia Music Partners.\n\nDeep Startups is an e
 vent series that features knowledgeable entrepreneurs who discuss their ex
 periences forming companies that solve big-picture current problems. These
  individuals speak to the concept of ‘deep startups’ and how to create
  companies that make a difference. Each Deep Startups event focuses on a d
 ifferent broad topic in engineering/technology\, and allows for student Q&

 e served customers operating in a wide variety of harsh environments—fro
 m deep ocean basins to outer space. Huff began his career working for offs
 hore drilling companies after graduating from Georgia Tech. This experienc
 e\, and his penchant for adventure\, eventually led him to became presiden
 t and CEO of Oceaneering\, which he transformed from a small offshore oil 
 and diving company into a highly successful multinational corporation. Huf
 f achieved this by tying oil exploration with deep sea exploration. In add
 ition to many other achievements\, the company developed the remote-operat
 ed vehicles that assisted in the exploration of the Titanic\, the wreckage
  of the Challenger capsule\, and the remains of the H.L. Hunley\, a Civil

 , Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\nStatus: published\n\nAbstract
 :\n\nMorphing matter harnesses the programmability in material structures 
 and compositions to achieve transformative behaviors and integrates sensin
 g\, actuation\, and computation to create adaptive and responsive material
  systems. These material systems can be leveraged to design soft robots\, 
 self-assembling furniture\, adaptive fabrics\, and self-folding foods. In 
 this talk\, Lining presents the recent works in the Morphing Matter Lab\, 
 Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University and hig
 hlights several robotic morphing materials that weave advanced manufacturi
 ng with computational tools. Her team believes that the term “robotics
 ” does not only refer to conventional robotic forms and controls but als
 o connects to the artifacts’ ability to make decisions\, adapt\, move\, 
 and respond to different stimuli. More information from the lab site: http
 s://morphingmatter.cs.cmu.edu/.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\nLining Yao is an Assist
 ant Professor of Human-Computer Interaction Institute (HCII) at Carnegie M
 ellon University\, School of Computer Science\, directing the Morphing Mat
 ter Lab. Morphing Matter lab develops materials\, tools\, and applications
  of adaptive\, dynamic and intelligent morphing matter from nano to macro 
 scales. Research often combines material science\, computational fabricati
 on and creative design practices. Lining and her lab work anti-disciplinar
 ily\, publishing and exhibiting across science\, engineering\, design and 
 art. Lining gained her PhD at MIT Media Lab\, where she combined biologica
 l and engineering approaches to develop physical materials with dynamic an
 d tunable properties including shape\, color\, stiffness\, texture and den
 sity. Beyond her teaching and research in the School of Computer Science\,
  Lining holds courtesy appointments at Mechanical Engineering\, as well as
  Material Sciences and Engineering. She is supervising undergraduate and g
 raduate students across the College of Engineering and College of Art.\n\n

 Abstract: Organic\, hybrid\, and 2D materials have attracted interest for 
 electronic applications due to their potential for use in low-cost\, large
 -area\, flexible electronic devices. Here we will report on recent develop
 ments pertaining to surface modifiers and dopants that could impact the ch
 arge injection/collection/transport processes in organic light emitting di
 odes\, organic field effect transistors\, and photovoltaic devices. In par
 ticular\, we will examine how N-heterocylic carbenes assemble on gold subs
 trates\, the impact of the surface dipole on the work function of the gold
 . We will also discuss the development of metallocenes-based dimers as n-d
 opants and very briefly describe metal dithiolene complexes as p-dopants f
 or organic semiconductors and their impact of device performance.\n\nBio: 
 Seth Marder is currently the Georgia Power Chair of Energy Efficiency and

 :\n\nDigital technologies have increasingly begun to permeate the driving 
 experience in recent years to support continually increasing information a
 nd cognitive needs associated with driving and non-driving activities in t
 he car. With recent pilot projects like Waymo\, Uber\, and Tesla\, we can 
 anticipate that autonomous driving technology will have a significant impa
 ct on accelerating the transformation of automobile interface in its more 
 than one hundred years long history. As the technology matures\, and initi
 al public enthusiasm wanes\, designing a better user experience within thi
 s new mode of travel will be of critical importance for our future. In thi
 s talk\, we examined the user experience issues that will arise with the i
 ntroduction of autonomous driving including the attention-activity changes
  and related design considerations. We then discuss current disciplinary-s
 pecific design methodologies and introduce a more comprehensive approach t
 o the design space to optimize the opportunities for user interaction with
  examples to meet the changes in the vehicle and the associated transporta
 tion service.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\nAs an assistant professor\, Dr. Wei Wang 
 brings industrial and international experience to the Industrial Design pr
 ogram at Georgia Institute of Technology. His research interests stand in 
 the interactive technology\, human-computer interaction and smart product 
 design from user experience perspective. He is directing DesigNext lab in 
 School of Industrial Design on the applications of emerging interface desi
 gn in future consumer electronics. His patents in gesture interaction and 
 mobile service have been applied widely in consumer products by Nokia and 
 Microsoft. Wang won multiply international awards\, included the Annual En
 gagement and Enterprise Awards from Queen Mary University of London (UK)\,
  Annual Achievement Awards from Nokia (Finland)\, the Science and Technolo
 gy Award of China Mechanical Industry (China)\, and the Michelin Challenge
  Design Award in the worldwide. Wang used to work in Nokia Research Center
 \, Hunan University and Queen Mary University of London before he joined G
 eorgia Tech in 2016. Wang is a member of IDSA and ACM SIGCHI\, and receive
 d his Ph.D. in design in 2008.\n\nSchedule of Brown Bag Speakers Fall 2019

 \nTITLE: Edge Computing: A New Disruptive Force\n\nABSTRACT:\n\nAt the hei
 ght of its success\, cloud computing is yielding to edge computing. Why is
  this happening? What is the unique value proposition of edge computing? A
 s real-world deployments of edge computing appear\, how will the lives of 
 end users be improved? What new applications and capabilities will they se
 e? Which applications run best at the edge\, which run best in the cloud\,
  and which should straddle the edge and cloud? How do we build systems tha
 t are seamless to the user but leverage all the available tiers of computi
 ng to best effect? Based on my team’s decade-long exploration of edge co
 mputing\, I will share my insights on these questions. Of particular inter
 est is a new class of “wearable cognitive assistance” applications tha
 t lie at the convergence of edge computing\, wearable devices\, and cognit
 ive algorithms (e.g. computer vision\, speech recognition\, natural langua
 ge processing). Drawing upon insights from these edge-native applications\
 , I will explore what hardware and software infrastructure is needed for e
 dge computing.\n\nBIO:\n\nSatya’s multi-decade research career has focus
 ed on the challenges of performance\, scalability\, availability\, and tru
 st in information systems that reach from the cloud to the mobile edge of 
 the internet. In the course of this work\, he has pioneered many advances 
 in distributed systems\, mobile computing\, pervasive computing\, and the 
 internet of things (IoT). As described in How we created edge computing\, 
 Satya’s seminal 2009 publication The Case for VM-based Cloudlets in Mobi
 le Computing\, and the ensuing research has led to the emergence of edge c
 omputing (also known as fog computing). Satya is the Carnegie Group Profes
 sor of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. He received his Ph.
 D. in computer science from Carnegie Mellon after bachelor’s and master
 ’s degrees from the Indian Institute of Technology\, Madras. He is a Fel
 low of the ACM and the IEEE. For a more detailed bio\, see Satya’s Wikip
 edia entry.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.edu/node/625978#0

  per unit cell\, all atoms play the same role in producing the solid's glo
 bal response to external perturbations. Disordered materials are not simil
 arly constrained and a new principle emerges: independence of bond-level r
 esponse. This allows one to drive the system to different regimes of behav
 ior by successively removing individual bonds. We can thus exploit disorde
 r to achieve unique\, varied\, textured and tunable global response or lon
 g-range interactions inspired by allosteric behavior in proteins. While th
 is approach is successful for systems with only a few degrees of freedom\,
  it is difficult to scale up the number of elements to be controlled or sc
 ale down the size of the individual components. However\, because a materi
 al has a memory of under what conditions it has been aged\, we can direct 
 the aging using Nature’s greedy algorithms to achieve a variety of mecha
 nical functionalities.\n\nABOUT THE SPEAKER\n\nSidney Nagel is the Stein-F

 apons.\n\nIn more than 50 years of operation\, the Cold War battlefields c
 reated over 100 metric tons of plutonium\, produced tens of thousands of n
 uclear warheads\, oversaw more than 1000 detonations\, and left behind a l
 egacy of contaminated facilities\, soils\, and ground water.\n\nThe extent
  of long-term adverse health effects will depend on the mobility of pluton
 ium and other actinides in the environment and on our ability to develop c
 ost-effective scientific methods of removing or isolating actinides from t
 he environment. Studying the complex chemistry of plutonium and the actini
 des in the environment is one of the most important technological challeng
 es\, and one of the greatest scientific challenges in actinide science tod
 ay.\n\nDavid L. Clark will summarize our current understanding of actinide
  chemistry in the environment\, and how that understanding was used in the
  decontamination and decommissioning of the Rocky Flats Site\, where pluto
 nium triggers for U.S. nuclear weapons were manufactured. At Rocky Flats\,
  synchrotron radiation measurements made at the Stanford Synchrotron Radia
 tion Laboratory were developed into a science-based decision-making tool t
 hat saved billions of dollars by focusing site-directed efforts in the cor
 rect areas\, and aided the most extensive cleanup in the history of Superf
 und legislation to finish one year ahead of schedule\, ultimately resultin
 g in billions of dollars in taxpayer savings. (LA-UR-15-22406)\n\nAbout th
 e Speaker\n\nDavid L. Clark [1] is a Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL)
  Fellow and Director of the Laboratory’s National Security Education Cen
 ter. He received a B.S. in chemistry in 1982 from the University of Washin
 gton\, and a Ph.D. in 1986 from Indiana University.\n\nClark was a postdoc
 toral fellow at the University of Oxford before joining Los Alamos Nationa
 l Laboratory as a J. Robert Oppenheimer Fellow in 1988. He became a Techni
 cal Staff Member in the Isotope and Nuclear Chemistry Division in 1989. Si
 nce then he has held various leadership positions at Los Alamos\, includin
 g PI for the Laboratory’s BES Heavy Element Chemistry program (1993 – 
 2014)\, Solubility Task for the Yucca Mountain Project (1993-1997)\, Sourc
 e Term Test Program for the WIPP license application (1996-1997)\, program
  manager for plutonium aging and pit lifetime assessments\, (1998-2003)\, 
 and Capture Manager for the Plutonium Science and Research Strategy (2009 
 – 2019).\n\nClark has been highly involved in service to the actinide ch
 emistry community through organization of ACS symposia (1993-present)\, se
 rvice on organizing and steering committees of 3 international actinide co
 nferences including Actinides (1993-present)\, Migration (2003 – present
 )\, and Plutonium Futures – the Science (1997-present)\; the establishme
 nt and stewardship of the Seaborg Institute at Los Alamos (1997-2009)\; th
 e development of the Plutonium Science and Research Strategy (2009-present
 )\; and much more.\n\nHe has served the DOE as a technical advisor for env
 ironmental stewardship including the Rocky Flats cleanup and closure (1995
 -2005)\, closure of High-Level Waste tanks at the Savannah River Site (201
 1)\, and as a technical advisor to the DOE High Level Waste Corporate Boar
 d (2009-2011).\n\nHe is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advan
 cement of Science\, and a Los Alamos Laboratory Fellow. He is the recipien
 t of two ACS national awards - the Nobel Laureate Signature Award (1988) a
 nd the Glenn Seaborg Award in Nuclear Chemistry (2017). He has also been h
 onored with several Defense Programs Awards of Excellence\, the most notab
 le in 2006 for his work on pit lifetime assessments for the nation.\n\nHis
  research interests are in the molecular and electronic structure of actin
 ide materials\, applications of synchrotron radiation to nuclear security\
 , behavior of actinide and fission products in the environment\, the aging
  effects of nuclear weapons materials\, and the education of judges on the
  methods of science.\n\nHe is an international authority on the chemistry 
 and physics of the actinides\, and has published over 175 peer-reviewed pu
 blications\, encyclopedia and book chapters.\n\nAbout Frontiers in Science

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Postdoc
 \nExtras: Free food\nStatus: published\n\nHow do your grading practices im
 pact your students? Research shows that not all grading practices motivate
  student learning. In fact\, some practices have the opposite effect. For 
 example\, grade curving: did you know grade curving demotivates students? 
 Goergia Tech students have said that grade curving promotes stress\, cheat
 ing\, competition\, and even apathy Students feel there is little room to 
 ever fail and that if they do\, their grade is unlikely to recover. Additi
 onally\, feedback regarding the curve does not come in early enough for st
 udents to determine whether or not they should drop the class.\n\nWhile cu
 rving is a common problematic grading practice\, it isn’t the only one. 
 However\, equitable grading practices that are mathematically accurate\, r
 esistant to bias\, and motivating to students to achieve academic growth a
 nd success can refocus students on learning\, not just the grade. Many ins
 tructors wish to apply these principles in their teaching\, but it can be 
 difficult to determine how to do so\, leaving faculty to wonder how to be 
 both fair and rigorous when grading.\n\nThese topics will be further explo
 red in the Center for Teaching and Learning workshop\, Grading: Are Both E
 quity and Rigor Possible? Participants will ponder common grading approach
 es through the lens of equity to identify opportunities to restore some co
 mpassion to the grading process while still using grades to accurately ref
 lect student learning. The primary goals of the workshop are to help instr
 uctors to consider why they use their grading style compared to available 
 alternatives\, understand grades in the context of how they affect the mot
 ivation\, learning\, and well-being of their students\, and develop an awa
 reness of equitable versus non-equitable grading strategies.\n\nJoin us [1

 e a space for graduate students to come together in a welcoming environmen
 t to discuss\, share experiences and offer each other suggestions while bu
 ilding a community. Free dinner will be provided. The first session will b

 e discussing the topic "Managing advisor relationships at grad school". We
  have limited space so please RSVP early using the link: http://bit.ly/gra

 re often used interchangeably referring to the profession narrowly defined
  as a team of professionals who leverage technologies and processes to def
 end an organization’s systems and networks from attack. However\, this n
 arrow use of security sells the field short – there are in fact a number
  of key functions under the security umbrella\, one of which is cybersecur
 ity\, all of which are essential to the success of the organization. Some 
 such functions are: physical security\, fraud prevention\, privacy\, busin
 ess continuity\, disaster recovery\, and risk management\, although there 
 are still more. And though the security field is defined by the technical 
 “hacker” persona\, people with backgrounds\, skills\, and interests of
  a wide variety have all found success under the umbrella of work in the s
 ecurity field.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.edu/node/627447#0

SUMMARY:GVU Center Brown Bag: Yanni Loukissas "All Data Are Local: Thinkin
 g Critically in a Data-Driven Society"

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Public\
 , Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\nStatus: published\n\nAbstract
 :\n\nIn our data-driven society\, it is too easy to assume the transparenc
 y of data. Instead\, Yanni Loukissas argues in All Data Are Local\, we sho
 uld approach data sets with an awareness that data are created by humans a
 nd their dutiful machines\, at a time\, in a place\, with the instruments 
 at hand\, for audiences that are conditioned to receive them. The term dat
 a set implies something discrete\, complete\, and portable\, but it is non
 e of those things. Examining a series of data sources important for unders
 tanding the state of public life in the United States—Harvard's Arnold A
 rboretum\, the Digital Public Library of America\, UCLA's Television News 
 Archive\, and the real estate marketplace Zillow—Loukissas shows us how 
 to analyze data settings rather than data sets.\n\nLoukissas sets out six 
 principles: all data are local\; data have complex attachments to place\; 
 data are collected from heterogeneous sources\; data and algorithms are in
 extricably entangled\; interfaces recontextualize data\; and data are inde
 xes to local knowledge. He then provides a set of practical guidelines to 
 follow. To make his argument\, Loukissas employs a combination of qualitat
 ive research on data cultures and exploratory data visualizations. Rebutti
 ng the “myth of digital universalism\,” Loukissas reminds us of the me
 aning-making power of the local.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\nYanni Alexander Loukis
 sas is an Assistant Professor of Digital Media in the School of Literature
 \, Media\, and Communication at Georgia Tech\, where he directs the Local 
 Data Design Lab. His research is focused on helping creative people think 
 critically about the social implications of emerging technologies. His new
  monograph from MIT Press\, All Data Are Local: Thinking Critically in a D
 ata-Driven Society\, is addressed to a growing audience of practitioners w
 ho want to work with unfamiliar data both effectively and ethically. Origi
 nally trained as an architect at Cornell\, he subsequently attended MIT\, 
 where he received a Master of Science and a PhD in Design and Computation 
 and completed postdoctoral work at the Program in Science\, Technology and
  Society.\n\nSchedule of Brown Bag Speakers Fall 2019 [1]\n\nLinks:\n[0]

 ing\nProfessor\, Materials Science and Engineering\nArthur F. Thurnau Prof
 essor\, Mechanical Engineering\nJanine Johnson Weins Professor\n\nThe firs
 t concept that will be explored in this talk is the time-dependent nature 
 of cracking in polymeric coatings\, with a particular interest in the coat
 ings for automotive polymeric glazing. Experiments suggest that crack velo
 cities in these particular systems\, while sensitive to visco-elastic prop
 erties\, are controlled by kinetic processes.\nThe second topic will addre
 ss the adhesion of ice to polymeric coatings. In particular\, the work ill
 ustrates the dual role that both interfacial strength and interfacial toug
 hness play in determining the conditions for delamination. Experimental st
 udies show that the force required to delaminate a layer of ice from a pol
 ymeric coating depends on the scale of the problem.\n\n“Collecting Long-

 \nPetit Distinguished Lecture by Wendell Lim\, University of California\, 
 San Francisco\n\nThe eras of molecular biology and genomics have given us 
 an unprecedented picture of the molecular components underlying living sys
 tems. Nonetheless\, our understanding of how these components are assemble
 d to generate precision physiological systems remains far less developed.\
 n\nTo approach this problem\, we and others have been using synthetic biol
 ogy methods to empirically explore how molecular components can be used to
  construct novel cellular functions. Using these approaches\, we have show
 n that we can reprogram living cellular machines that carry out new precis
 ion functions\, including therapeutic immune cells that precisely recogniz
 e and eliminate cancer cells\, or cells that self-organize into tissues.\n
 \nBy merging our understanding of cellular machines with our knowledge of 
 our bodies and its diseases\, we envision the development of a mature fiel
 d of cell engineering with a toolbox of optimized molecular parts and circ
 uit architectures\, as well as disease and "GPS" sensors that allow the ce
 ll to target specific sites in the body or brain.\n\nSuch a platform will 
 allow us to rapidly and flexibly prototype and design cells that can ident
 ify sites of disease or degeneration and execute precisely targeted and co
 ntrolled therapeutic actions.\n\nAbout the Speaker\nWendell Lim is the Bye

 h focuses on the design principles of molecular circuits that govern cell 
 decision-making and responses. His lab has made contributions in understan
 ding the molecular machinery of cell signaling and how molecular modules h

 \nProf. John Rogers - Depts. of Materials Science and Engineering\, Biomed
 ical Engineering and Medicine\; Northwestern University\nAbstract: A remar
 kable feature of modern integrated circuit technology is its ability to op
 erate in a stable fashion\, with almost perfect reliability\, without phys
 ical or chemical change. Recently developed classes of electronic material
 s create an opportunity to engineer the opposite outcome\, in the form of 
 ‘transient’ devices that dissolve\, disintegrate or otherwise disappea
 r at triggered times or with controlled rates. Water-soluble transient ele
 ctronics serve as the foundations for interesting applications in zero-imp
 act environmental monitors\, 'green' consumer electronics and bio-resorbab
 le biomedical implants. This presentation describes the foundational conce
 pts in chemistry\, materials science and assembly processes for bioresorba
 ble electronics in 1D\, 2D and 3D architectures. Wireless sensors of intra
 cranial temperature\, pressure and electrophysiology designed for use in t
 reatment of traumatic brain injury and nerve stimulators configured for ac
 celerated neuroregeneration provide application examples.\n\nBio: John A. 
 Rogers is the Louis Simpson and Kimberly Querrey Professor of Materials Sc
 ience and Engineering\, Biomedical Engineering and Medicine at Northwester
 n University\, with affiliate appointments in Mechanical Engineering\, Ele
 ctrical and Computer Engineering and Chemistry\, where he is also Director
  of the newly endowed Center for Bio-Integrated Electronics. He has publis
 hed more than 650 papers\, is a co-inventor on more than 100 patents and h

 \nLecture Topic | Planning Sustainably: An Infrastructure-based Approach\n
 \nThe lecture will address the sustainability of infrastructure and the En
 vision® rating system\, developed at Harvard University. Then\, sustainab
 le infrastructure will be introduced as the starting point and a prerequis
 ite for sustainable cities and an inextricable part of urban planning and 
 configuration. The proposed systems approach emphasizes the synergies and 
 interconnections between infrastructure processes\, including physical str
 uctures and operations\, natural processes\, and the end-user. Each system
  is decoded\, addressing (a) the main demand or consumption that must be c
 overed by the system\, (b) the strategic approach and resources to meet th
 e demand\, and (c) the facilities and networks required. When a system is 
 relevant to the needs or performance of another system\, the connection is
  highlighted supporting the development of multifaceted\, integrated plans
 .\n\nAbout Professor Spiro Pollalis\n\nSpiro Pollalis\, a Harvard Universi
 ty professor of 34 years\, is an expert in the sustainability of infrastru
 cture and cities. At Harvard\, he has developed the Envision® sustainabil
 ity rating system.\n\nProfessor Pollalis consults governments and the priv
 ate sector on sustainability\, and he is the chief planner for several sus
 tainable cities\, including a new city in Pakistan for 600\,000 people\, n
 ow under construction.\n\nProfessor Pollalis collaborates on sustainabilit
 y with the World Bank\, the Inter-American Development Bank\, IFC\, the Un
 ited Nations\, and the World Wide Fund For Nature (WWF).\n\nProf. Pollalis

 nLecture Topic | Planning Sustainably: An Infrastructure-based Approach\n\
 nThe lecture will address the sustainability of infrastructure and the Env
 ision® rating system\, developed at Harvard University. Then\, sustainabl
 e infrastructure will be introduced as the starting point and a prerequisi
 te for sustainable cities and an inextricable part of urban planning and c
 onfiguration. The proposed systems approach emphasizes the synergies and i
 nterconnections between infrastructure processes\, including physical stru
 ctures and operations\, natural processes\, and the end-user. Each system 
 is decoded\, addressing (a) the main demand or consumption that must be co
 vered by the system\, (b) the strategic approach and resources to meet the
  demand\, and (c) the facilities and networks required. When a system is r
 elevant to the needs or performance of another system\, the connection is 
 highlighted supporting the development of multifaceted\, integrated plans.
 \n\nAbout Professor Spiro Pollalis\n\nSpiro Pollalis\, a Harvard Universit
 y professor of 34 years\, is an expert in the sustainability of infrastruc
 ture and cities. At Harvard\, he has developed the Envision® sustainabili
 ty rating system.\n\nProfessor Pollalis consults governments and the priva
 te sector on sustainability\, and he is the chief planner for several sust
 ainable cities\, including a new city in Pakistan for 600\,000 people\, no
 w under construction.\n\nProfessor Pollalis collaborates on sustainability
  with the World Bank\, the Inter-American Development Bank\, IFC\, the Uni
 ted Nations\, and the World Wide Fund For Nature (WWF).\n\nProf. Pollalis

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Public\
 , Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\nStatus: published\n\nAbstract
 :\n\nWalt Disney is described variously as an American entrepreneur\, a fi
 lm producer\, a pioneer of the American animation industry\, the founder o
 f the theme park industry. Public perception of him is of a filmmaker with
  an uncanny ability to create entertaining family oriented animated films 
 and experiences. More than that Walt Disney was a visionary who believed t
 echnology should be pushed to its limits to realize stories\, provide expe
 riences\, and build worlds. That a technology did not exist or was not yet
  ready to solve a problem was not an obstacle – his answer was always 
 – build it.\n\nDisney Stories: Getting to Digital (Lee & Madej\, 2012) d
 iscusses how Walt Disney and then the Walt Disney Company narratives evolv
 ed from traditional animation to computer games and online narrative exper
 iences. In the upcoming second edition (January 2020) I look at technology
  as it has been used to enhance story from the first feature animation Sno
 w White and the Seven Dwarfs to the first VR short Cycles. This talk first
  provides an overview of the technological innovation that has driven the 
 many arms of the Disney empire\, most recently the animatronics for the ne
 w Star Wars worlds at Walt Disney World and Disneyland. This is followed b
 y a presentation of Disney advances in technology made in the genre of ani
 mated films from the 1940s to today as Disney moved from the traditional m
 ethods of integrating animation and live action in Song of the South and l
 ater Mary Poppins\, to CGI assisted films beginning with Tron\, through ma
 ny iterations to Big Hero Six\, and finally to VR and its use in shorts su
 ch as Styles.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\nKrystina Madej is Professor of Practice a
 t Georgia Tech\, Atlanta\, where she has taught since 2011. Her research i
 nterests are play and games\, interactivity and collaboration in social me
 dia\, material culture of media\, and narrative across media. In particula
 r she looks at children’s traditional and digital games\, play and narra
 tives in social media and Disney’s approach to narrative and technology.
  Her research has resulted in a number of books including Physical Play an
 d Children’s Digital Games (2016)\, Interactivity\, Collaboration\, and 
 Authoring in Social Media (2015)\, and Disney Stories: Getting to Digital 
 (2012). She has been visiting professor and taught courses in Narrative at
  the Center for Digital Media in Vancouver\, Canada\, and in Children’s 
 Games\, Disney Animation\, and Design Thinking at the University of Lower 
 Silesia in Wroclaw\, Poland (both for the Erasmus program and the Masters 
 in Big Data\, Digital Media\, and Trendwatching ). Dr. Madej’s first int
 erest was in Fine Arts: she received her BFA from Concordia University in 
 Montreal\, Canada. She went on to a career as a design strategist and part
 nered with a colleague to start the first Industrial Design and Communicat
 ions business in western Canada that used computer technologies for the de
 sign and production of products\, graphics\, and exhibits. She later retur
 ned to academia and completed her doctoral studies in Digital Narrative at
  the School of Interactive Art and Technology\, SFU\, Vancouver\, Canada.\

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Postdoc
 \, Public\, Undergraduate students\nStatus: published\n\nIn 2016\, Georgia
  Tech collected preliminary data through an online survey of 771 students.
  The report found that 10% of Georgia Tech’s students responded being in
  need of food assistance and that 16% prioritized working at their job ove
 r academics and extracurricular activities. Georgia Tech’s actions to fi
 ll this gap include opening Klemis Kitchen in 2015\, an on-campus food pan
 try that provides leftover food from the dining halls and Panera Bread as 
 well as canned donations from other sources. However\, in Spring 2019\, on
 ly 100 students have self-identified and enrolled in the program\; a far c
 ry from the 10% of students estimated in the 2016 survey.\n\nTo ensure bot
 h the highest levels of health and academic performance of all GT students
 \, we need to understand the effects of food insecurity/security on health
  and academic performance\, identify effective methods of recognizing stud
 ents who are food insecure\, and develop interventions to that will increa
 se food security among those students who are food insecure. The purpose o
 f this preliminary study is to address the first two issues. Our specific 
 aims are 1) to understand the impact of food security/insecurity on academ
 ic performance and 2) identify passive tools that can predict profiles of 
 food insecure students that are specific to students within a semester per
 iod.\n\nModerators:\n\nJon Sanford\, Professor\, School of Industrial Desi

  Science Chalmers University of Technology\, Göteborg\, Sweden\n\nAbstrac
 t\n\nHigh performance polymer matrix composites (PMC) have a high specific
  stiffness and can be used to easily manufacture highly complex components
 . Hierarchical composite materials with microstructures designed for speci
 fic multifunctional purposes are an important development area for modern 
 materials. The demand for new materials is increasing and the rate at whic
 h those new materials should complete the development cycle is decreasing.
  In order to meet this demand\, existing material development frameworks m
 ust be enhanced via more progressive human-computer materials development.
  A few techniques are presented to meet this need including: a combination
  of modern imaging techniques and finite element analysis of in-situ fiber
  bundles\, a stochastic approach utilizing experimental through-thickness 
 scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of nanocomposites to create virt
 ual representations of the experimental microstructure\, an adaptation of 
 hierarchical materials developed in nature\, and the potential for a low e
 nergy\, high performance processing methods.\n\nBiography\n\nDr. Brina Bli
 nzler is an Assistant Professor in Composite Mechanics at Chalmers Univers
 ity of Technology. Her research focuses on composite process modeling\, me
 chanics\, and material informatics. She leads the all Wood Composites Plat
 form and is a representative for the Chalmers Graphene Center in the Focus
  Area: Multifunctional Composites and Coatings. She has recently received 
 the Jacob Wallenbergs Foundation: Material Science Research Award (2019) a
 nd the Hasselblad Foundation: Female Scientist Award (2018). Previously\, 
 Dr. Blinzler conducted research at Scaled Composites\, Easton Baseball/ So
 ftball and other companies. In addition\, she was a recipient of the NASA 
 Graduate Student Researchers Program fellowship\, holds a PhD in Civil Eng

 an air mobility (UAM)" has entered the vernacular of the aerospace industr
 y. Silicon Valley unicorns\, individual billionaires\, startup companies\,
  automotive firms\, and traditional aerospace manufacturers worldwide are 
 investing in the development of over 200 electric vertical takeoff and lan
 ding (eVTOL) aircraft to serve the UAM market. Often called "flying cars" 
 or "air taxis\," these aircraft designs are novel\, incorporating many new
  technologies. We are entering only the early days of UAM\, an era of grea
 t uncertainty. No one understands whether and how the market will emerge. 
 No one understands how eVTOL aircraft will be certified. No one understand
 s how to manage the airspace in cities when filled with air taxis. No one 
 understands how cities will regulate "vertiports" where aircraft will land
  to embark and disembark passengers. No one understands which aircraft des
 igns will "win" and how the best design varies city to city. In this era o
 f uncertainty\, there is great opportunity\, and there is great risk. This
  talk will provide an introduction to the current landscape of urban air m
 obility\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.edu/node/628104#0

 :\n\nLook around at some of the familiar objects and materials in your sur
 roundings. These things can be transformed. By combining everyday material
 s with computing\, we can extend and reimagine their expressive and functi
 onal possibilities. We can also invite people to explore a new design spac
 e through making. In this talk\, HyunJoo will present her recent work in i
 ntegrating paper and recycled materials with computing and discuss a suite
  of computational design tools her research team has developed. She will d
 escribe how combinations of everyday materials with computation can expand
  creative possibilities while leveraging familiarity to empower designers 
 and learners.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\nHyunJoo Oh is an assistant professor with
  a joint appointment in the School of Industrial Design and the School of 
 Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech. Working at the intersection of Huma
 n-Computer Interaction and Design\, she develops computational design tool
 s that integrate everyday materials with computing. Her work investigates 
 fundamental questions on how people see and think\, and make\, in particul
 ar how those are closely linked and shape each other. Her work has been pu
 blished and exhibited at ACM SIGCHI conferences such as CHI\, TEI\, and DI
 S\, and featured in venues including CNET and Maker Ed.\n\nSchedule of Bro

 \, Public\, Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\, Freebies\nStatus: 
 published\n\nA Frontiers in Science Lecture to celebrate 2019\, the Intern
 ational Year of the Periodic Table\nIn 1997\, the Japanese oceanographer Y
 oshiyuki Nozaki compiled a periodic table of ocean chemistry\, encapsulati
 ng the distribution of elements as a function of depth. In this periodic t
 able\, many elements share similar patterns\, classified into just a few c
 ategories. The similarities indicate a common set of mechanisms behind the
  ocean cycling of elements.\n\nThe interaction of ocean circulation\, chem
 istry\, and biology sets the distribution of elements in the ocean. For ex
 ample\, nonreactive elements are nearly uniformly distributed in the water
  column\, homogenized by ocean circulation and mixing.\n\nNutrient element
 s are depleted near the surface because of biological consumption and enri
 ched in mid-depth due to decomposition of organic matter. Some trace metal
 s – such as Fe\, Zn\, Ni\, and Cd – follow this pattern. In contrast\,
  some heavy metals – like Al\, Mn\, Co\, and Pb – are subsumed into pa
 rticles and removed from seawater.\n\nBuilding on the insights from Nozaki
 ’s periodic table\, this talk will interpret recent measurements of chan
 ging seawater chemistry\, highlighting the importance of rising carbon dio
 xide concentration in the air\, climate change\, and pollution of rivers a
 nd atmosphere.\n\nAbout the Speaker\nTakamitsu “Taka” Ito [1] is an as
 sociate professor in the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences\, where 
 he teaches physical and chemical oceanography. He received a Ph.D. in Eart
 h\, Atmospheric\, and Planetary Sciences in 2005 from Massachusetts Instit
 ute of Technology. His research has focused on the cycling of carbon\, oxy
 gen\, and iron in the global oceans\, using observations\, theory\, and co
 mputational modeling.\n\nAbout Frontiers in Science Lectures\nLectures in 
 this series are intended to inform\, engage\, and inspire students\, facul
 ty\, staff\, and the public on developments\, breakthroughs\, and topics o
 f general interest in the sciences and mathematics. Lecturers tailor their
  talks for nonexpert audiences.\n\nAbout the Periodic Table Frontiers in S

 \nThe College of Sciences\; the School of Literature\, Media\, and Communi
 cation\; and the Georgia Tech Library invite all to a conversation among s
 cience fiction authors and scientists\, as part of Georgia Tech's celebrat
 ion of the International Year of the Periodic Table (IYPT).\n\nIYPT has br
 ought well-deserved attention to the periodic table and the chemical eleme
 nts. As the world celebrates the 150th anniversary of the periodic table\,
  chemical elements have never been so central to the global imagination. J
 ust look at recent blockbuster films revolving around vibranium and infini
 ty stones.\n\nBut did chemical elements really ever go out of style?\n\nMo
 derated by Charlie Bennett [01]\, this panel discussion brings two scienti
 sts and two science fiction writers together to explore how science and ar
 t have long influenced each other while shaping public understanding of th
 e periodic table and chemical elements and their role in our everyday live
 s.\n\nGeorgia Tech scientists Deirdre Shoemaker [02] and M.G. Finn [03] wi
 ll have a conversation with Milton J. Davis [04]\, science fiction writer 
 and chemist\, and Amanda Weiss [05]\, an up-and-coming science fiction aut
 hor who teaches Japanese at Georgia Tech. Through their conversation\, we 
 hope to get a closer look at how new — and sometimes very old! — ideas
  about how the world works circulate through science\, fiction\, and cultu
 re at large.\n\nAbout the Discussants\nCharlie Bennett [01] is the public 
 engagement librarian and economics specialist at Georgia Tech. He holds a 
 Master’s in Library and Information Science from Valdosta State Universi
 ty\, and a B.S. in Economics and in Science\, Technology\, and Culture fro
 m Georgia Tech. His research interests include the role of the library in 
 civic life and scholarly communication to the general public. Bennett prod
 uces and co-hosts the rock’n’roll library show " Lost in the Stacks [0
 6] " and the talk show " The North Avenue Lounge [07]\, " both on WREK Atl
 anta\, as well as the media podcast " Supercontext [08]. " The first scien
 ce fiction he can remember reading is the Tripods trilogy by John Christop
 her\, and he’s been fascinated by the genre ever since.\n\nMilton J. Dav
 is [09] is a black speculative fiction writer. He is the author of 17 nove
 ls and editor or co-editor of seven anthologies. He owns MVmedia\, LLC\, a
  small publishing company specializing in science fiction\, fantasy\, and 
 "Sword and Soul." Davies is also the technical director of Hill Manufactur
 ing\, a company specializing in maintenance chemicals and products. As a r
 esearch chemist\, he has developed polymers for the textile\, janitorial\,
  and computer industries. In 2004\, he received a U.S. patent for a cleani
 ng solvent and dispenser pen designed to remove conformal coatings and adh
 esives from circuit boards and other electrical equipment.\n\nM.G. Finn [1

 \nThe College of Sciences\; the School of Literature\, Media\, and Communi
 cation\; and the Georgia Tech Library invite all to the grand opening of t
 he exhibit ASTOUNDING ELEMENTS: Celebrating the Periodic Table.\n\nSince J
 anuary\, the College of Sciences has been hosting lectures\, events\, and 
 activities to acknowledge the 150-year-long contribution of the periodic t
 able to science. In collaboration with campus partners\, the College of Sc
 iences has brought the periodic table and chemical elements to the attenti
 on of the Georgia Tech community and the public through arts\, athletics\,
  academics\, and fun. ASTOUNDING ELEMENTS brings many of these pieces toge
 ther\, including:\n\n- Elements in science fiction\, in collaboration with
  the School of Literature\, Media\, and Communication\n- Periodic table ma
 keover: design and prototypes\, in collaboration with the School of Indust
 rial Design\, College of Design\n- Art inspired by the periodic table and 
 chemical elements\, in collaboration with the Georgia Tech Office of the A
 rts\n- Scavenger Hunt: buildings and element partners\, in collaboration w
 ith various building managers on campus\n- Favorite elements of Georgia Te
 ch students\, faculty\, and staff\n\nThe exhibit will formally open with r
 emarks from Ameet Doshi\, Library Director of Service Experience and Progr
 am Design\; Karen Head\, associate chair of the School of Literature\, Med
 ia\, and Communication\; and Susan Lozier\, Dean of the College of Science
 s.\n\nImmediately following the opening remarks is a panel discussion: Fro
 m Myth to Marvel: The Role of Elements in Science\, Fiction\, and Culture\
 n\nThe International Year of the Periodic Table has brought well-deserved 
 attention to the periodic table and the chemical elements. As the world ce
 lebrates 2019 the 150th anniversary of the periodic table\, chemical eleme
 nts have never been so central to the global imagination. Just look at rec
 ent blockbuster films revolving around vibranium and infinity stones.\n\nB
 ut did chemical elements really ever go out of style?\n\nModerated by Geor
 gia Tech librarian and North Avenue Lounge radio host Charlie Bennett [01]
 \, this panel discussion brings two scientists and two science fiction aut
 hors together to explore how science and art have long influenced one othe
 r while shaping public understanding of the periodic table and chemical el
 ements and their role in our everyday lives.\n\nGeorgia Tech physicist Dei
 rdre Shoemaker [02] and chemist M.G. Finn [03] will have a conversation wi
 th Milton Davis [04]\, chemist and award-winning author of nineteen novels
  and editor of nine anthologies\, and Amanda Weiss [05]\, an up-and-coming
  science fiction and fantasy author who teaches Japanese at Georgia Tech. 
 Through their conversation\, we hope to get a closer look at how new — a
 nd sometimes very old! — ideas about how the world works circulate throu
 gh science\, fiction\, and culture at large.\n\nAbout the Discussants\n\nC
 harlie Bennett [01] is the public engagement librarian and economics speci
 alist at Georgia Tech. He holds a Master’s in Library and Information Sc

 :\n\nAs industrial design continues to embrace digital manufacturing\, we 
 are in constant danger of losing the culturally indicative crafts that exp
 ress individual cultures. As global wealth inequality grows\, can we creat
 e low tech\, parametric tools to bring products to global market? Does the
  spread of generative design in products have to mean a drop in artisanal 
 jobs that support entire towns and regions? Can we blur the line between d
 esigner and maker by working collaboratively? In this talk we look at ways
  that new design tools can go to emerging and potential markets to create 
 opportunity without losing jobs\, skills\, and traditions.\n\nThis topic c
 an connect design to production by looking upstream\, encourages socially 
 sustainable practice. This can allow us to design for production near the 
 material source taking advantage of embodied skills instead of homogenizin
 g design.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\nLisa Marks is an industrial designer whose wo
 rk combines craft and algorithmic design. She uses technological adaptatio
 ns of traditional techniques to promote sustainable methods of production 
 that help endangered craft communities. Her work has been presented at des
 ign weeks in New York\, Milan\, and Bangkok and has recently won the 2019 
 International Grand Prix Lexus Design Award. Lisa holds an MFA from Parson

 ntric lighting design for older adults. With the American senior populatio
 n expected to increase dramatically over the next decade\, this talk is ti
 mely.\n\nAs she describes her talk:\n\nLighting in buildings is one main e
 nvironmental attribute that plays a significant role in managing biologica
 l\, behavioral\, and psychological symptoms through impacting visual and c
 ircadian systems.\n\nConsidering the age-related changes in eyes and circa
 dian system\, specialized lighting design is essential to promote overall 
 health and well-being in older people.\n\nThis seminar describes specific 
 lighting needs of older adults\, explores scientific methods to design hea
 lthy environmental lighting for this age group\, and outlines a recently c
 onducted study which evaluates the effects of tuning ambient illuminations
  on improving sleep quality and cognitive functions in older adults.\n\nLi
 ght refreshments will be served.\n\nAbout Nastaran Shishegar\n\nNastaran S
 hishegar is a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Cham

 \nTITLE: Software Testing: And the Challenges (and Opportunities) Keep Com
 ing!\n\nABSTRACT:\n\nDisruptive shifts in software application types and s
 oftware development environments create challenges to software testing tha
 t need to be addressed to ensure software quality and reduce the cost of s
 oftware development time. Over the years\, the size and complexity of soft
 ware have grown as well as the need for fast-changing codebases\, fault de
 tection strategies\, and test case generation and selection. To meet these
  challenges\, techniques such as regression testing\, selection/prioritiza
 tion\, and fault localization have been developed as well as specialized t
 esting techniques for GUIs\, object-oriented software\, mobile computing\,
  and continuous evolution of software to name a few. This talk presents an
  overview of these challenges and solutions and references Mary Jean Harro
 ld’s achievements in these areas. The talk then explores current challen
 ges and opportunities that bring problems that cannot be solved by state o
 f art techniques\, including applications that are machine learning applic
 ations or use machine learning as part of a system where components intera
 ct and evolve. Other challenges that need to be explored involve autonomou
 s systems\, cloud applications\, and data churn. As software becomes more 
 autonomous\, its operations and outputs become less predictable at test wr
 iting time\; hence\, the traditional nature of assert (Actual\, Expected) 
 test oracles does not work and needs to be addressed.\n\nBIO:\n\nMary Lou 
 Soffa is the Owen R. Cheatham Professor of Sciences in the Computer Scienc
 e Department at the University of Virginia\, serving as the department cha
 ir from 2004 to 2012. Her research interests include software testing\, pr
 ogram analysis\, warehouse scale computing\, software systems for multi-co
 re architectures\, and optimizing compilers. She has published over 175 ar
 ticles and has directed 32 Ph.D. students to completion\, half of whom are
  women and including Mary Jean Harrold. Soffa is an ACM and IEEE Fellow. O
 ther notable awards include the Ken Kennedy Award for contributions to com
 piler technology\, the IEEE Software Engineering Women in Science and Engi
 neering Leadership Award\, and the Anita Borg Technical Leadership Award. 
 For her career-long dedication to diversity in computing\, she received th
 e Presidential Award for Excellence in Science\, Mathematics and Engineeri
 ng Mentoring and Computing Research Association (CRA) Nico Habermann Award
 . She has served as conference chair\, program chair\, or program committe
 e member for conferences in programming languages\, architecture\, and sof
 tware engineering. She served on the ACM Publications Board and on the Com
 puter Research Association Board (CRA). She co-founded the CRA-W Graduate 
 Cohort for Women\, the Cohort for Associate Professors and the Grad Cohort
  for Underrepresented Minorities and Persons with Disabilities.\n\nLinks:\

 \nAssistant Professor Sung Jin Park | Coulter Department of Biomedical Eng
 ineering\, Georgia Institute of Technology & Emory University\, School of 
 Medicine\nAbstract: Utilizing living materials as building blocks for engi
 neered biohybrid systems enables replicating biological activities in vitr
 o at a cellular\, tissue and organ level. Furthermore\, integrating stem c
 ell technologies offer new strategies of personalized medicine\, from enab
 ling drug discovery to engineering transplantable artificial organs. In th
 is talk\, I will focus on our tissue-engineering approach to recapitulate 
 biological functions at tissue- and system- levels\, by advancing the cont
 rol of living building blocks. First\, I will discuss optogenetic approach
  for the development of biohybrid soft-robotic swimmers capable of coordin
 ated muscle contraction and undulatory swimming. Second\, I will present t
 he development of tissue-level model of a human inherited cardiac monogeni
 c disease\, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia\, which 
 can recapitulate exercise-induce arrhythmia upon optogenetic and catechola
 mine stimulation. Both biohybrid examples illustrate the potential and pro
 gress of the biohybrid systems to transform human muscle disease models as
  well as artificial tissues and organs.\n\nBio: Sung Jin Park\, PhD\, is a
 n Assistant Professor in the Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering 
 at Georgia Tech and Emory University School of Medicine. He received Bache
 lor's and Master's degrees in Mechanical Engineering from Seoul National U
 niversity in Korea\, and his PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Stanford U
 niversity with double Master's degree in Electrical Engineering. He then c
 ontinued postdoctoral research at the John A. Paulson School of Engineerin
 g and Applied Sciences and Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engine
 ering at Harvard University\, where he developed engineered biological sys
 tems using living materials as building blocks. He has focused on enabling
  the control of biological systems across scales from artificial cells\, t
 o engineered tissues\, to artificial soft-robots\, in order to better reca
 pitulate biological activities and to build more complex living system. Hi
 s work on tissue-engineered soft-robotic rays and photosynthetic organelle
 s was selected as a cover of Science and Nature Biotechnology. The tissue-
 engineered ray was also selected as one of Popular Science best inventions
  of year 2016 and Gold Edison Award of 2017 and featured in more than 100 
 news outlets such as New York Times\, BBC\, Financial Times\, and Economis

 behaviors and\, instead\, change and adapt dynamically.\n\nThese interacti
 ons resemble improvisation in the performing arts\, and this talk presents
  a new improvisation-based framework for thinking about future cities. Kri
 stian Kloeckl moves beyond the smart city concept by unlocking performativ
 ity\, and specifically improvisation\, as a new design approach and explor
 es how city lights\, buses\, plazas\, and other urban environments are cap
 able of behavior beyond scripts.\n\nDrawing on research of digital cities 
 and design theory\, he makes improvisation useful and applicable to the co
 ndition of today’s technology-imbued cities and proposes a new future fo
 r responsive urban design.\n\nThis talk is a preview of the forthcoming bo
 ok „The Urban Improvise. Improvisation-Based Design for Hybrid Cities“
  by Kristian Kloeckl and published by Yale University Press. http://www.ur

 n\nPlease register [1] to attend this upcoming teaching with technology sp
 otlight session!\n\nEvery semester instructors all over Georgia Tech are p
 roducing and utilizing videos in their courses. Have you ever wondered how
  students are using these resources? Are you concerned that students might
  not be watching the videos or might be skipping through them? Have you ev
 er thought about how you could make your videos more engaging? Watching vi
 deos is a very passive activity--but it doesn’t have to stay that way\, 
 thanks to innovative technologies that allow you to add interactive featur
 es to your videos.\n\nIn this spotlight workshop\, we will explore the tec
 hnology and pedagogy behind Interactive Video Quizzes from Kaltura. We’l
 l examine how you can use Kaltura to create quizzes that exist inside vide
 os and describe how you can best leverage this technology in your own cour
 ses. We’ll also discuss the concept of frequent quizzing and explain how
  such a technique can benefit student learning. And we’ll hear from Dr. 
 Tatiana Rudechenko\, a faculty member in Scheller\, who has successfully i
 mplemented video quizzing in her own course. Tatiana will share her experi
 ence\, lessons learned\, and tips for using this technique with your stude
 nts.\n\nJoin us and learn first-hand about video quizzing and generate ide
 as for innovative uses with your colleagues. Bring your laptop to get a ju
 mp on creating your own video quizzes by engaging in hands-on activities o
 r simply follow along with someone at your table. All are encouraged to at
 tend--from novices who have just started to think about creating videos to
  experts looking to add another tool to their video skill set. We look for
 ward to seeing you!\n\nLunch will be provided. Please register [1] to join

 \nTITLE: Lessons from Designing\, Building\, and Operating a Hyper-scale G
 lobal Wide Area Network\n\nABSTRACT:\n\nCloud computing has ushered in a n
 ew class of hyper-scale systems\, characterized by large-scale distributed
  systems\, global connectivity\, and ubiquitous computing models that span
  the spectrum from centralized data centers to the edge. Powering these hy
 per-scales are global networks that connect end-users through various othe
 r networks and devices to the cloud. In this talk\, we describe our journe
 y in building the network of one of the biggest cloud systems\, Microsoft 
 Azure. This network is built out of 130K+ miles of terrestrial and subsea 
 cables\, processes an average of 30 billion packets/second\, and interconn
 ects with more than 20K peering points around the globe. We describe many 
 of the technological and engineering building blocks that enable us to bui
 ld and reliably operate this network\, including innovations in fiber opti
 cs\, software-defined networking\, network design\, switch software and gl
 obal-scale monitoring\, and simulation software.\n\nBIO:\n\nYousef Khalidi
  is responsible for product and program management for Azure Networking\, 
 which covers Microsoft’s global investments in cloud networking software
  and hardware. He drives strategic business planning\, including world-wid
 e partner coverage and deep integration with Microsoft services. Khalidi w

 crosoft Azure (code named Red Dog) and has served in several engineering\,
  product management\, and architectural roles in Azure. Prior to joining M
 icrosoft\, Khalidi spent 14 years at Sun Microsystems\, where he was a dis
 tinguished engineer. At Sun\, he held several R&D\, architecture\, and man
 agement positions in enterprise software\, including CTO and chief archite
 ct of Solaris\, chief architect of Sun’s N1 utility computing platform\,
  chief architect and director of the Sun Cluster product line\, and as a p
 rincipal architect of the Solaris MC and the Spring advanced development p
 rojects. Khalidi also served as a member of Sun’s Technical Advisory Cou
 ncil. Khalidi earned his bachelor’s degree in computer science from West
  Virginia University\, where he graduated summa cum laude. He earned his M
 .S. and Ph.D. in information and computer science from Georgia Tech\, with

 \, Public\, Undergraduate students\nStatus: published\n\nYou're invited to
  attend the talk\n\n"Structural Design in Motion: Computational Synthesis 
 of Kinetic Structures Using Topology Optimization"\n\nby\n\nProf. Kai Jame
 s\nAssistant Professor\nUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\n\nThur
 sday\, November 14\n3 - 4 PM\nGuggenheim 442\n\nAbout the Talk:\nTopology 
 optimization is a powerful and well-established tool for generating optima
 l structural designs. Unlike the sizing and shape optimization approaches 
 that preceded it\, this method simultaneously optimizes both the shape and
  topology of the structure\, thus creating the potential to algorithmicall
 y generate novel design concepts and configurations with minimal input fro
 m human designers. This capability makes topology optimization a potential
  key ingredient in the quest to achieve automated design of complex mechan
 ical systems.\n\nThis talk will discuss our ongoing efforts to expand the 
 capability of the topology optimization method to enable computational syn
 thesis of kinetic structures. This unique class of structures is designed 
 to exhibit precisely tailored motion\, while maintaining structural integr
 ity. The talk will present our general methodology and results from severa
 l example problems including optimal design of a bi-stable airfoil\, multi
 material design of self-actuating mechanisms containing shape memory polym
 ers\, and topology optimization of multi-body mechanisms. The talk will co
 nclude with a discussion of ongoing and future research projects in which 
 we explore the use of topology optimization for the design of soft robots 
 and compound machines.​\n\nAbout the Speaker:\nKai James is an Assistant
  Professor in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the University of
  Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\, and the Principal Investigator of the Comp
 utational Design Innovation Lab at UIUC. From 2012 to 2015\, he was a post
 doc in the Computational Mechanics Group at Columbia University\, and he e
 arned his PhD in aerospace engineering from the University of Toronto in 2
 012. His research focuses on computational solid mechanics and computation
 al design optimization with an emphasis on problems involving various sour
 ces of nonlinearity\, such as viscoelastic creep\, superelasticity\, and l
 arge deformations.\n\nHe is especially interested in developing novel algo
 rithms that leverage high-fidelity computational models and topology optim
 ization methods for conceptual design and synthesis of complex engineering
  structures. Some of his major research projects include aerostructural op
 timization of transonic aircraft wings\, structural design optimization of
  a cardiovascular stent\, optimal design of a bi-stable airfoil\, and comp
 utational synthesis of multi-body systems. Dr. James is the recipient of t
 he NSF CAREER award (2018)\, and has also received several teaching honors
  including being named “Teacher of the Year” by the UIUC chapter of th
 e American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics in 2017.\n\nLinks:\n[

 n————————————\n\nIn this era of big data\, one of 
 the most crucial fields in Computer Science is data mining. Extracting mea
 ningful information from a large amount of data in a reasonable time becam
 e possible mainly through two types of advancements - a) algorithmic\, suc
 h as fast approximate algorithms and efficient learning algorithms\, and b
 ) architectural\, such as machines with massive compute power involving di
 stributed multi-core processors and high throughput accelerators. With the
  end of Dennard scaling\, the free lunch in performance improvement throug
 h processor frequency increases ended\, and multiple cores became a practi
 cal solution to gain performance. In current-generation processors\, paral
 lelism is ubiquitous\, and thus parallel algorithms are a necessary means 
 to utilize computing resources efficiently. In our work\, we address the f
 ollowing questions - how well do the critical data mining algorithms of cu
 rrent interest fit with today's parallel architectures\, which algorithmic
  and mapping opportunities can we leverage to further improve performance\
 , and what are the challenges and gains in such efforts?\n\nFirst\, we inv
 estigate a classical application in large scale data stream processing - t
 he frequency estimation problem - for GPU scale parallelism. Among the app
 roximate solutions with sublinear memory requirements\, Sketching algorith
 ms are a popular choice for this task due to their desirable trade-off bet
 ween estimation accuracy and space-time efficiency. However\, most of the 
 past work on sketch-based frequency estimation focused on CPU implementati
 ons\, with little exploration of throughput-optimized parallel architectur
 es such as GPUs. In our work\, we propose a novel approach for sketches\, 
 which exploits the natural skewness in the data to efficiently utilize the
  massive amounts of parallelism available in modern GPUs.\n\nNext\, we exp
 lore one of the most common and important tasks in data mining - identific
 ation of most frequent elements - on modern distributed settings with both
  multi-node as well as multi-core parallelism. In this work\, we start by 
 observing that the existing approximate algorithms\, although theoreticall
 y sound\, are suboptimal from the performance perspective. Specifically\, 
 for identifying top-K frequent items\, Count-Min Sketch (CMS) has an excel
 lent update time but lacks the important property of reducibility\, which 
 is needed for exploiting available massive data parallelism. On the other 
 end\, the popular Frequent Algorithm (FA) leads to reducible summaries\, b
 ut the update costs are high. Our approach Topkapi\, a fast and parallel a
 lgorithm for finding top-K frequent items\, gives the best of both worlds\
 , i.e.\, it is reducible like FA and has an efficient update time similar 
 to CMS. In addition\, Topkapi possesses strong theoretical guarantees and 
 leads to significant performance gains\, relative to past work.\n\nFinally
 \, we explore opportunities for improvement in Word2Vec\, a word embedding
  method. Word embedding is an essential application for Machine learning a
 nd Natural Language Processing\, since distributed representations of word
 s significantly improve accuracy in text processing applications\, such as
  machine translation\, sentiment analysis\, and query answering. This time
 \, we target Single Instruction Multiple Data parallelism. With increasing
  vector length of commodity CPUs\, such as AVX-512 with a vector length of
  512 bits\, efficient vector processing unit utilization becomes a major p
 erformance game-changer. So\, we look into the performance landscape for c
 urrent Word2Vec approaches on CPUs and propose new ideas to overcome their
  shortcomings.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.edu/node/628952#0

  properties of cells assembled into tissues\, and the impact of these muta
 tions on tissue-level properties of human myocardium has not been reported
 . In this talk\, I will present an in vitro hiPSC-CM-based platform to stu
 dy the tissue-level properties of engineered human myocardium. I will illu
 strate how this hiPSCCM- based platform can be used to investigate pathoge
 nic mechanisms in the deadly\, exercise-triggered inherited arrhythmia cat
 echolaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT). In addition\, I
  will show how we combined this novel platform with genome editing and ide
 ntified new therapeutic target for CPVT.\n\nLunch Provided at 1pm\nRSVP li

 on\, the Cancer Sidekick Foundation\, Team Curious\, and Unite for Sight S
 outheast. Kathy focuses on product\, ethics\, responsibility\, and technol
 ogy.\n\nAt the Harvard Kennedy School\, Kathy created and teaches Product 
 Management and Society\, and launched Product and Society. Kathy is an Aff
 iliate at the Harvard Berkman Klein Center where she leads the Ethical Tec
 h working group\, and focuses on ethics in technology\, with an emphasis o

 \nDr. David Bruce Burckel: Sandia National Laboratories\nAbstract: Bulk op
 tical materials like glasses and semiconductors (for infrared appli-cation
 s) have continuous translational symmetry on the scale of the design wavel
 ength\, and hence support a continuum of allowed modes with frequency depe
 ndent optical constants dictated by the material dispersion relationship. 
 Much of the recent progress in optical materials has been driven by period
 ic structuring of materials on finer and finer scales relative to the desi
 gn wave-length. Recently metasurface optics employing planar plasmonic str
 uctures ar-rayed in a two-dimensional (2D) array to affect beam steering a
 nd lensing were reported. Subsequent analysis of the physical mechanisms a
 t play revealed that such a planar system has a maximum theoretical effici
 ency of 25%. The analysis further showed that by enabling current flow in 
 the third dimension\, the direction of travel through the lens\, this rest
 riction could be lifted.\n\nIn this seminar\, I will discuss our recent wo
 rk on fabrication and characterization of 3D meta-films\, suspended struct
 ures with sub-wavelength structuring along all three dimensions and a tota
 l thickness of < 4-μm. The struc-tures are fabricated on ~ 1-μm thick si
 licon nitride membranes using a new CMOS compatible membrane pro-jection l
 ithography (MPL) approach. Elimination of the bulk substrate allows us to 
 collect almost all the transmit-ted and reflected light from the sample an
 d simplifies modeling and design. The response of these 3D meta-films poss
 esses features characteristic of the metallic meta-atoms as well as slab p
 hotonic crystal resonances resulting from the periodic unit cell array\, t
 he nitride walls and support membrane. I will outline the fabrication sequ
 ence and present measured infrared transmission characterization of 3D uni
 t cells with vertically oriented elliptical plasmonic inclusions in the un
 it cell. Furthermore\, we demonstrate control over the coupling between th
 e plasmonic modes of the metallic inclusion and photonic crystal slab mode
 s of the support matrix by adjusting the dimensions of the inclusions. The
  ability to control the coupling between the unit cell decoration and the 
 unit cell matrix while also allowing for current flow in all three dimensi
 ons offers a powerful new design element for next generation optical eleme
 nts.\n\nBio: Bruce Burckel received his BS in Electrical Engineering from 
 the University of New Mexico in 1993\, at which point he was evenly split 
 between attending graduate school\, medical school or law school. Graduate
  school won out\, probably costing him millions of dollars in lifetime ear
 nings\, but he is only mildly bitter about this. He received his MS (1995 
 – optical non-contact temperature measurement) and PhD (2004 – general
 ized transverse Bragg waveguiding) also from the University of New Mexico\
 , separated by a stint contemplating a software start-up\, studying contro
 l system theory\, designing space-based relay mirror telescopes and studyi
 ng atmospheric propagation for high power laser applications. Although his
  PhD was centered on photonic applications of interferometric lithography 
 at the micro and nano-scale\, he secured a Post-Doctoral position in an in
 organic chemistry lab studying self-assembled nanocomposite coatings. He i
 s currently a Principal Member of the Technical Staff at Sandia National L
 aboratories\, where he leads several efforts in micron-scale 3D fabricatio
 n and structured electromagnetics. He is frequently found counseling stude
 nts on the importance of career planning\, as well as studying for the LCA
 T in local coffee shops.\n\nIf you wish to meet with the speaker\, please

 , Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\nStatus: published\n\nAbstract
 :\n\nMy research combines techniques in natural language processing\, mach
 ine learning and theories in social science to better understand human lan
 guage and build intelligent systems to support human-human and human-compu
 ter communication. In this talk\, I will explain my research from two spec
 ific studies. The first part studies what makes language persuasive by int
 roducing a semi-supervised neural network to recognize persuasion strategi
 es in loan requests on crowdfunding platforms\, and further designed neura
 l encoder-decoder systems to automatically transforming inappropriately su
 bjective framing into a neutral point of view. The second focuses on model
 ing how people seek and offer support via language in online cancer suppor
 t communities and building interventions to support patient communication.
  Through these examples\, I show how we can accurately and efficiently bui
 ld better language technologies for social good.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\nDiyi Y
 ang is an assistant professor in the School of Interactive Computing at Ge
 orgia Tech. She is interested in natural language processing (such as lang
 uage generation\, semantics\, discourse)\, and social computing. Diyi rece
 ived her PhD from the Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon U
 niversity\, and her bachelor's degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University\,
  China. She has published more than 40 papers at leading NLP/HCI conferenc
 es\, and received several best paper award nominations from EMNLP 2015\, I
 CWSM 2016\, and SIGCHI 2019. She has served as an area chair for ACL\, NAA
 CL and CSCW conferences.\n\nSchedule of Brown Bag Speakers Fall 2019 [1]\n

 to the concept of implicit bias and how these unconscious\, automatic ment
 al processes may impact behaviors such as evaluating candidates during fac
 ulty search and/or RPT processes.\n\n• Empirical research on vitaes\, le
 tters of recommendations\, and teaching evaluations to illustrate the impa
 ct of implicit bias on decisions.\n\n• Effective practices and strategie
 s for faculty search and RPT committees.\n\nThese workshops will be facili
 tated by Paul Benkeser\, senior associate chair and professor\, Wallace H.

  (UAM) with electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft is emer
 ging as a promising aviation market for both cargo delivery and passenger 
 travel. The rise of UAM is being driven by the convergence of two technolo
 gies: autonomy and electric aircraft propulsion. Although promising\, thes
 e technologies place limits on the discovery of viable markets\, the timel
 ine of introduction\, and the design of operational paradigms. In particul
 ar\, electric propulsion—when achieved with battery energy storage—is 
 highly constraining in terms of aircraft payload\, range\, and speed perfo
 rmance and in terms of operational tempo and ground infrastructure. This t
 alk will discuss recent work in modeling aircraft performance and operatio
 ns for UAM and will highlight the challenges and opportunities in particul
 ar urban markets.\n\nSESSION SPEAKER\n\nBrian German [1]\, Daniel Guggenhe

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Public\
 , Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\nStatus: review\n\nAbstract:\n
 \nGames are an important form of play. While games are played by all age g
 roups\, for children\, play and games are fundamental to learning and\, fo
 r them\, all play is serious. Serious games\, which have become a prevalen
 t game genre for adults\, need not be confined to adult or adolescent audi
 ences. Both from the perspective of serious topics and serious gameplay\, 
 older children as they head towards adolescence\, and younger children as 
 they negotiate their way through their first years of school\, warrant the
  consideration of games developed to tackle topics that are becoming incre
 asingly important to their health and well-being. In games\, social value 
 can only be created through a narrative a child can relate to. Whether we 
 turn to David Winnicott on child development\, Jerome Bruner on acts of me
 aning\, or Kieran Egan on languaged learning\, story dominates as the most
  valuable experience in the construction of a child's world and how they a
 ct within it. The added context of a personal approach\, one that is cultu
 rally relevant\, can create an influential avenue through which children c
 an be provided with opportunities for gaining knowledge about problems tha
 t\, while they may be national or global\, are local to them – knowledge
  that could be critical to their well-being and survival in an increasingl
 y hostile world. Games offer children a space that supports learning on th
 eir own. Moving from the typical to the atypical game\, from simple proble
 m solving that increases cognitive skills\, to social problem solving that
  teaches empathy\, is a shift that can happen through participation in nar
 rative dialogue. Social value in a game can exist when the cognitive load 
 is not in computing numbers but in the challenge of uncovering the more in
 triguing stories beyond the surface of coded messages. In this talk I pres
 ent a case study that describes the design thinking process of a group of 
 EU Erasmus students\, each of whom brings their own cultural perspective a
 nd personal story to addressing how they would introduce children to conte
 mporary issues\, which either affect them currently\, or will affect them 
 as they grow up\, through narrative in physically engaging games. A number
  of their final game designs are provided in outline.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\nD
 r. Krystina Madej is Professor of the Practice at Georgia Tech\, Atlanta. 
 At Tech since 2011\, she teaches about and researches how humans have adap
 ted their narratives to changing media throughout the centuries\, physical
  play and children's interaction with digital games that are based in narr
 ative\, and in Disney's approach to stories across media since the 1920s. 
 Adjunct Professor with the School for Interactive Art and Technology (SIAT
 ) at Simon Fraser University\, Vancouver\, for ten years\, she taught as V
 isiting Professor for the Center for Digital Media's Master’s degree pro
 gram. She is research faculty at University of Lower Silesia\, Wroclaw\, P
 oland where as Visiting Professor she teaches Disney History and Children
 ’s Game Design for the Erasmus Program and Design Thinking and History o
 f Social Media for the Big Data\, Digital Media\, and Trendwatching Master
 ’s Program. Prior to returning to academia in 1999\, she was principal o
 f a communications and design firm for 15 years\, where\, as design strate
 gist\, she planned and created successful branding programs and exhibits f
 or government\, business\, industry\, and museums.\n\nSchedule of Brown Ba

 n\nMatthew Hong: Personalizing Health Management Through Human-Centered Da
 ta Augmentation\n\nDuring complex chronic treatment\, adolescent patients 
 (ages 10-19) must communicate all illness needs to the care team so they c
 an access relevant health resources when most needed. This communication i
 s challenging because patients\, family caregivers and clinicians have unm
 atched experiences\, conceptions and linguistic representations of indicat
 ors of health. Most importantly\, patients lack the means to capture and r
 epresent their felt illness experience. My colleagues and I addressed thes
 e challenges by advancing personalized computing technology and human-cent
 ric methods that inform collaborative approaches for managing personal hea
 lth data. In this talk\, I will describe how technology can be designed to
  effectively scaffold patients’ gradual participation in managing their 
 illness. I draw from Health Informatics\, Participatory Design\, and Human
 -Computer Interaction to show how we can augment clinically-generated\, an
 d patient-generated data in ways that cater to personal health needs. I wi
 ll discuss how human-centered data-augmentation can help designers create 
 intelligent systems to improve chronic care for pediatric patients.\n\nLar
 a Martin: Understanding the Technological and Experiential Requirements of
  Improvisational Storytelling Agents\n\nAlthough we are currently riding a
  technological wave of personal assistants\, many of these agents still st
 ruggle to communicate appropriately. Humans are natural storytellers\, so 
 it would be fitting if artificial intelligence could tell stories as well.
  Automated story generation is an area of AI research that aims to create 
 agents that tell “good” stories. Previous story generation systems use
  planning to create new stories\, but these systems require a vast amount 
 of knowledge engineering. The stories created by these systems are coheren
 t\, but only a finite set of stories can be generated. In contrast\, very 
 large language models have recently made the headlines in the natural lang
 uage processing community. Though impressive on the surface\, these models
  begin to lose coherence over time. My research looks at various technique
 s of automated story generation\, focusing on the perceived creativity of 
 the generated stories. Here\, I define a creative product as one that is b
 oth novel and useful. In my dissertation\, I theorize that a jointly proba
 bilistic and causal model will provide more creative stories for readers o
 f stories generated from an improvisational storytelling system than solel
 y probabilistic or causal models.\n\nEmily Wall: Mitigating Implicit Human
  Bias in Visual Analytics\n\nImplicit bias is a term used to describe the 
 way that our culture\, experiences\, and stereotypes can unconsciously imp
 act our attitudes and decision making. Such biases\, like racial or gender
  bias\, can impact decision making in critical ways\, propagating long-sta
 nding institutional and systemic biases. However\, as decision making is i
 ncreasingly taking place with the aid of data-driven visual representation
 s (including interactive visualization tools like Tableau\, among others)\
 , we are afforded a new opportunity with respect to the detection and miti
 gation of implicit biases. In this talk\, I describe (1) how user interact
 ions with data can be used to approximate implicit biases and (2) how visu
 alization systems can be designed to make implicit biases more explicit by
  increasing awareness. By creating systems that promote real-time awarenes
 s of bias\, people can reflect on their behavior and decision making and u
 ltimately engage in a less-biased decision making process.\n\nSpeaker Bios
 :\n\nMatthew Hong is a PhD candidate in Human-Centered Computing in Intera
 ctive Computing. His research lies at the intersection of Human-Computer I
 nteraction and Health Informatics\, and focuses on supporting pediatric pa
 tients’ management of complex chronic conditions through the design and 
 deployment of human-centered health technologies. He has published in lead
 ing conference proceedings and journals\, including the ACM Conference on 
 Human Factors in Computing Systems (ACM SIGCHI) and the Journal of America
 n Medical Informatics Association (JAMIA).\n\nLara Martin is a Human-Cente
 red Computing PhD Candidate in the College of Computing at Georgia Tech. H
 er work resides in the field of Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence wit
 h a focus on natural language applications. Lara is currently working on a
 utomated story generation\, but her previous work includes speech processi
 ng and analyzing online communities. Lara earned a Masters of Language Tec
 hnologies from Carnegie Mellon University and a BS in Computer Science & L
 inguistics from Rutgers University—New Brunswick. In addition to winning
  the Foley Scholar Award\, she recently received the Best Doctoral Consort

  she is advised by Dr. Alex Endert. Her research interests lie at the inte
 rsection of cognitive science and data visualization. Particularly\, her d
 issertation has focused on increasing awareness of unconscious and implici
 t human biases via the design and evaluation of (1) computational approach
 es to quantify bias from user interaction and (2) interfaces to support vi
 sual data analysis. Her research has been supported by the Siemens FutureM
 aker Fellowship and the National Physical Science Consortium Fellowship\, 
 among others.\n\nSchedule of Brown Bag Speakers Fall 2019 [1]\n\nLinks:\n[

 CTS\n\nMichaelanne Dye\, Towards Access and Beyond: Human Infrastructures 
 in Constrained Contexts\n\nMore than four billion people across the world 
 have yet to access the internet. Despite increasing initiatives by compani
 es and governments to bring more people online\, social\, economic\, and p
 olitical barriers continue to limit internet engagements among underrepres
 ented groups. As a result\, people collaborate to overcome barriers to par
 ticipation\, particularly in politically and economically constrained cont
 exts. I address these concerns by focusing on the case of Cuba\, where up 
 until recently internet access was limited to just five percent of the pop
 ulation. Presenting results from qualitative inquiry in Havana from 2014 t
 o 2017\, I describe how participants are receiving and engaging with the i
 ncremental introduction of access to the world wide web. I also present in
 sights into how people have created their own versions of the internet in 
 response to barriers. I draw on the framework of human infrastructure to r
 eveal how people are sustaining multiple\, disconnected information networ
 ks\, and the tensions and opportunities that arise from these efforts. I w
 ill discuss how this work contributes to our understanding of the social e
 lements embedded in internet adoption and participation\, and how this cri
 tical understanding has implications for the design of social media system
 s in order to better support collaborative efforts of historically underre
 presented groups.\n\nCaitlyn Seim\, Wearable Tactile Stimulation for Strok
 e Rehabilitation\n\nStroke is one of the leading causes of disability in t
 he United States and globally. Many stroke survivors lose function in thei
 r upper extremities\, which can make it difficult to do everyday tasks lik
 e dressing or eating. In addition to weakness and loss of sensation\, spas
 ticity and tone can cause hands to be involuntarily clenched in a rigid po
 sition — a problem for which there are few effective treatments. Getting
  rehabilitation therapy can be a challenge and up to 50% of stroke survivo
 rs do not qualify for traditional exercise-based therapies. This talk intr
 oduces a novel stimulation method and mobile\, wearable devices to provide
  therapy on-the-go and to those with very limited movement. Preliminary re
 sults and next steps are presented. Our stimulation method may provide a p
 owerful tool to reduce disability after a stroke\, and the wearable form f
 actor allows users to receive intensive therapy during their normal daily 
 routine.\n\nStevie Chancellor\, Human-Centered Algorithms for Deviant Ment
 al Health Behaviors Online\n\nSocial media can provide a rich platform for
  those seeking better health and support through difficult experiences. Ye
 t\, it can also provide space for deviant mental health behaviors\, very d
 angerous and stigmatized behaviors related to mental health. These behavio
 rs are dangerous to participants as well as to platform health. However\, 
 the deep complexities of mental health and these clandestine behaviors res
 ist straightforward\, data-driven approaches to detection and intervention
 . In this talk\, I will describe how human-centered algorithms can identif
 y and assess deviant mental health behaviors in pro-eating disorder commun
 ities\, bringing insights from Human Computer Interaction\, applied data s
 cience\, and social computing. In addition\, I will show how these approac
 hes can inform platform strategies for engaging with these communities. Fi
 nally\, I will briefly discuss how human-centered insights can be brought 
 to computational methods to answer our toughest questions about deviant be
 havior online.\n\nSPEAKER BIOS\n\nMichaelanne Dye is a Ph.D. candidate in 
 Human-Centered Computing in the School of Interactive Computing at the Geo

 \nStatus: published\n\nPilgyu Kang\, Ph.D.\nAssistant Professor\nDepartmen

 ics and Photonics for Biomedical Applications"\n\nNanostructuring of atomi
 cally-thin two-dimensional (2D) materials (e.g. graphene and MoS2) has sho
 wed promise to create new functionalities for various biomedical applicati
 ons\, especially flexible and wearable electronics. In this talk\, I will 
 discuss how nanostructuring of atomically-thin materials could create new 
 functionalities based on the fundamental studies of mechanics and photonic
 s at nanoscale. I will first discuss how nanostructuring of atomically-thi
 n 2D materials allows for the enhancement of their exceptional material pr
 operties and creating new functionalities in mechanical\, optical\, plasmo
 nic properties. I will also introduce a shrink nanomanufacturing method de
 veloped based on nanoscale mechanics of atomically-thin materials\, includ
 ing graphene and MoS2 atomic layers. Shrink nanomanufacturing allows large
 -scale\, uniform crumpling of graphene\, a two-dimensional (2D) material\,
  enabling mechanical stretchability and strain tunability of a flexible op
 toelectronic device. I will highlight a high-performance flexible photodet
 ector developed based on the shrink nanomanufacturing approach as well as 
 its potential in flexible/wearable optical sensing technology for biomedic
 al applications.\n\nLunch will be served at the beginning of the seminar.\

DESCRIPTION:Extras: Free Food\nStatus: approved\n\nJoin us for CREATE-X’
 s Deep Startups event featuring former Georgia Tech and Tennessee Titans f
 ootball star\, Derrick Morgan [1]. He will speak about lessons learned as 
 a professional football player\, as well as:\n\n- Emerging technology that
  impacts the game\n- What it takes to become a successful entrepreneur\n- 
 Opportunities for innovation in athletics\n\nAbout the speaker: Instilled 
 with hard work at a young age by his mom\, Derrick Morgan began working as
  soon he was old enough to acclimate himself to the real world. After rece
 iving more recognition on the football field during his junior year of hig
 h school\, Derrick set his mind to college football and arrived on the cam
 pus of Georgia Tech. In 2010\, his next goal was accomplished as well with
  the Tennessee Titans drafted him. While his goal was soon realized\, a to
 rn ACL injury turned Derrick’s world upside down\, forcing him to evalua
 te his value outside the football field.\n\nAbout Deep Startups: Deep Star
 tups is an events series that features knowledgeable entrepreneurs who dis
 cuss their experiences forming companies that solve big-picture current pr
 oblems. These individuals speak to the concept of ‘deep startups’ and 
 how to create companies that make a difference in specific industries. Eac
 h Deep Startups event focuses on a different broad topic in engineering/te
 chnology\, and allows for student Q&A at the end of the event.\n\nLinks:\n

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Postdoc
 \, Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\nStatus: published\n\nScience
  has made significant gains in the fight against infectious diseases in th
 e past several decades\, perhaps the most notable of which is declining mo
 rtality rates from HIV and hepatitis C. Nevertheless\, overall mortality r
 ates from all infectious diseases has remained relatively stable.\n\nThere
  are very real concerns about new drug development’s ability to keep up 
 with development of drug resistance and the speed at which infectious dise
 ases can cross the globe.\n\nIn early 2019\, Lien Van Hoecke and Kenny Roo
 se wrote in the Journal of Translational Medicine\, “Wider accessibility
  and implementation of antibody-based therapeutics is however hindered by 
 manufacturing challenges and high development costs inherent to protein-ba
 sed drugs. For these reasons\, alternative ways are being pursued to produ
 ce and deliver antibodies more cost-effectively without hampering safety. 
 Over the past decade\, messenger RNA (mRNA) based drugs have emerged as a 
 highly appealing new class of biologics that can be used to encode any pro
 tein of interest directly in vivo.”\n\nDr. Philip J. Santangelo is a Pro
 fessor in the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering. In 
 1998\, he obtained his Ph.D. in Engineering from the University of Califor
 nia at Davis\, and then was a postdoctoral fellowship at Sandia National L
 aboratories in Livermore\, California. He also spent time as a research fa
 culty member at Georgia Tech until becoming an Assistant Professor in 2007
 . Dr. Santangelo’s research focuses on the development of imaging tools 
 for the study of viral pathogenesis and immune responses\, and the develop
 ment of mRNA-based therapies and vaccines.\n\nOn Wednesday January 29th\, 
 2020\, Dr. Santangelo will discuss his research into mRNA-based therapeuti
 cs\, what they are and how we are using them for prevention and treatment.
 \n\nIf you are interested in new approaches to preventing and treating vir
 al infection\, including synthetic mRNA and gene modulation technology wil
 l find Dr. Santangelo’s Pediatric Tech Talk of high value.\n\nLunch will
  be provided free of charge for those who attend in person.\n\nRegister to

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Public\
 , Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\nStatus: draft\n\nAbstract:\n\
 nScience journalist Eva Wolfangel has specialized in investigating the eff
 ects of future technologies on society - by accompanying people who alread
 y make intensive use of these technologies today. She spent weeks under a 
 VR headset researching social virtual reality\, and she finally visited he
 r new "virtual" friends in their real lives in Kuwait\, Israel and various
  US states. These people already spend a large part of their lives in virt
 ual reality - and that is no reason for cultural pessimism. In Japan\, Wol
 fangel has accompanied researchers working on human augmentation\, and she
  has tried out many of these technologies\, met people here who are alread
 y using them and talked to many about their dream of an augmented future. 
 In this talk\, Eva Wolfangel discusses her research and how future technol
 ogies are already changing society today.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\nEva Wolfangel
  is a Knight Science Journalism Fellow at MIT. In 2018\, she was named Eur
 opean Science Writer of the Year by the Association of British Science Wri
 ters. She focuses on new technologies such as artificial intelligence and 
 virtual reality\, computer science\, data journalism\, interaction between
  digital and real worlds\, and space travel. Eva’s specialty is to combi
 ne creative writing and technical topics in order to reach a broad audienc
 e. She writes for major magazines and newspapers in Germany and Switzerlan
 d\, including Die Zeit\, Geo\, Der Spiegel\, and NZZ\, and also produces r
 adio features. As a VR journalist\, she reports from virtual worlds as par
 t of the journalistic cooperative RiffReporter [Hyperlink to: https://www.

 \, Undergraduate students\nStatus: published\n\nGA Tech Ocean Science and 
 Engineering Presents Dr. Donald R. Webster\, GA Tech School Civil and Envi
 ronmental Engineering\nUnderwater Flight of the Pteropod\n\nThe swimming c
 haracteristics achieved by flapping wings\, translating motion\, and shell
  pitching are studied from observations of shelled Antarctic pteropods (aq
 uatic snails nicknamed `sea butterfies'). A portable tomographic particle 
 image velocimetry (tomo-PIV) system was used to study these pteropods (Lim
 acina helicina antarctica) swim with a pair of parapodia (or “wings”) 
 via a unique flapping propulsion mechanism that incorporates similar techn
 iques as observed in small flying insects.\n\nThe swimming velocity is typ
 ically 14 – 30 mm/s for pteropod size ranging 1.5 – 5 mm\, and the pte
 ropod shell pitches forward-and-backward at 1.9 – 3 Hz. The pitching mot
 ion of the shell effectively positions the parapodia such that they flap d
 ownwards during both power and recovery strokes. The tomo-PIV measurements
  reveal the influence of the vortex structure created and shed from the pa
 rapodia on the generated lift forces.\n\nThe non-dimensional variables cha
 racterizing the motion of swimming pteropods are flapping\, translating\, 
 and pitching Reynolds numbers (i.e. Ref\, ReU\, and ReΩ). The observed sp
 ecimens swim within the same optimal Strouhal number range as observed for
  a broad range of species in air and water. The complex combination of bod
 y kinematics\, flow structures\, and resulting force balance may be signif
 icantly altered by thinning of the pteropod shell\, thus making pteropods 
 an indicator of the detrimental effects of ocean acidification.\n\nWebinar

  send you a thank-a-teacher note for the opportunities you provide for mea
 ningful learning and for the chance to have their work make a real impact.
 \n\nThis actually happened to Dr. Jennifer Glass\, an Associate Professor 
 in the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences\, when she incorporated a 
 Wikipedia assignment into her teaching. By completing a semester-long Wiki
 pedia editing project on scientific writing on notable topics in environme
 ntal sciences\, students developed a deep understanding of the course topi
 cs. They also developed skills to analyze digital sources of information f
 or accuracy and to collaboratively produce reliable information for variou
 s public audiences. While some students found that the assignment could be
  more tasking and time consuming than they expected\, others remarked how 
 they enjoyed this authentic learning activity\, and expressed their pride 
 in contributing to something larger than themselves.\n\nPlease join your c
 olleagues in this Teaching with Technology Spotlight session to learn how 
 Dr. Glass used Wikipedia as a teaching tool to help her students learn and

 , Undergraduate students\nStatus: published\n\nAvani Gupta\n(Advisor: Prof
 . Lakshmi N. Sankar)\n\nwill propose a doctoral thesis entitled\,\n\nAppli
 cation of an Extended Messinger Model to Ice Accretion on Complex Geometri
 es\n\nOn\n\nFriday\, February 7 at 10:00 a.m.\nMontgomery Knight Building 
 317\n\nAbstract\nIce accretion can significantly degrade the performance a
 nd the stability of an airborne vehicle. Therefore\, it is important to mo
 del this phenomenon accurately. While researchers have conducted extensive
  ice accretion studies in the past on airplane wings and helicopter blades
 \, very few of these studies are for more complex geometries such as fusel
 ages. This work proposes a methodology that extends an existing in-house E
 xtended Messinger ice accretion solver to complex geometries on unstructur
 ed grids\, with a marching process along surface streamlines to handle thr
 ee-dimensional flow effects.\n\nThe work completed to date includes sensit
 ivity studies for ice accretion and shedding on shortened Schweizer 269 ma
 in rotor blades and two-dimensional steady and oscillating airfoil ice acc
 retion cases\, on structured grids. Towards the goal of developing unstruc
 tured grid based methodologies\, several different cases with varying leve
 ls of complexity have been completed. These include a commercial transport
  airfoil\, a three-dimensional MS(1)-317 swept wing at different angles of
  attack\, and the Robin fuselage.\n\nUnstructured grid based analyses usin
 g commercial solvers such as STAR-CCM+ and ANSYS Fluent have been used to 
 date for the flow field and water droplet dispersed phase computations. Th
 e ice accretion is carried out using an in-house analysis called GT-ICE. T
 he predictions by GT-ICE have compared to available experimental data\, an
 d to predictions by LEWICE\, an industry standard solver developed at the 
 NASA Glenn Research Center.\n\nThe proposed work includes the development 
 of an unstructured grid based Eulerian droplet trajectory and collection e
 fficiency methodology using public domain modules within OpenFOAM\, couple
 d to a surface streamline visualization and data extraction process using 
 the public domain solver ParaView. GT-ICE will be employed for ice accreti
 on computations. The new methodology is capable of handling 2D and 3D\, st
 ructured and unstructured\, steady and unsteady flow analyses.\n\nCommitte

 \nDirect Write Processing of 3D Composite Nanostructures and 2D Electronic
  Materials using Focused Beams of Molecules and Electrons\nProf. Andrei Fe
 dorov - School of Mechanical Engineering\, Georgia Tech\nAbstract: Focused
  Electron Beam Induced Processing (FEBIP) is a powerful method for atom-by
 -atom fabrication of topologically complex nanostructures from a variety o
 f materials. It has potential to provide a comprehensive processing enviro
 nment for emerging electronic and quantum devices based on 2D materials. W
 e are developing a family of multi-mode energized micro/nano-jet technique
 s for local precursor delivery to resolve the FEBID challenges and to expa
 nd the range of useful precursors from gas to liquid phase for broader FEB
 IP applications. Energized micro/nano-jets of thermally or electro-kinetic
 ally energized precursors in both gas and liquid phase provide unique capa
 bilities for localized delivery of precursor molecules to the substrate\, 
 thus establishing locally controlled deposition/etching site for FEBIP. Un
 derstanding of fascinating and interacting chemistry and physics on the mo
 st fundamental level will be discussed as a route to develop new FEBIP mod
 es and applications to emerging electronic and quantum devices based on 2D
  materials.\n\nBio: Andrei G. Fedorov is Rae S. and Frank H. Chaired Profe
 ssor in the School of Mechanical Engineering and the Petit Institute for B
 ioengineering and Biosciences at Georgia Tech. His current research focuse
 s on electron-beam-mediated nanomanufacturing\, MEMS-enabled bioanalytical
  instrumentation\, thermal management of high performance electronics\, an
 d power generation with synergetic CO2 capture. Fedorov has authored/co-au
 thored over 200 archival articles in premier technical journals. His resea
 rch has led to development of new technologies for various applications\, 
 resulting in over 40 issued US patents and pending patent applications. Fo
 r his inventions of biomedical devices\, the World Technology Network (WTN
 )\, in cooperation with AAAS Science Magazine\, CNN\, and leading technolo
 gy companies\, selected Fedorov as a WTN Associate and one of the twenty-f

 , Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\nStatus: draft\n\nAbstract:\n\
 nGeorgia Tech has been at the forefront of sustainability since its incept
 ion in the 1880's. This is evidenced by the fact that the original brick b
 uildings on campus were made from indigenous Georgia red clay\, and Grant 
 Field was the home to football\, baseball and track. Fast forward to 2019 
 where we have just built the Kendeda Building for Innovative Sustainable D
 esign\, slated to be one of the most sustainable buildings in the southeas
 t\, on the path to meet the stringent requirements of the Living Building 
 Challenge. Come learn about the evolution of Georgia Tech's 400-acre ecosy
 stem and our commitment to sustainable campus development.\n\nSpeaker Bio:
 \n\nHoward Wertheimer is a Fellow in the American Institute of Architects 
 and a LEED Accredited Professional. From 2006-2019\, Howard served as the 
 AVP for Capital Planning & Space Management and Institute Architect at the
  Georgia Institute of Technology where he had strategic oversight of the C
 ampus Master Plan\, Landscape Master Plan\, Historic Preservation Plan\, c
 ampus-wide sustainability initiatives\, curation of public art\, and most 
 things visually exposed. He was responsible for the aesthetics and visual 
 vocabulary of the campus\, which currently includes over 16M square feet o
 f space in 200 buildings on 400 acres in Atlanta\, Georgia.\n\nWhile at Ge
 orgia Tech\, Howard lead the development of the Kendeda Building for Susta
 inable Design and has delivered numerous papers across the country on Geor
 gia Tech’s Living Building journey\, anticipated to be one the most envi
 ronmentally advanced education and research buildings on a university camp
 us in the Southeast.\n\nHoward is currently the Executive Vice President a
 nd Chief Operating Officer at the Piedmont Park Conservancy\, a non-profit
  overseeing the stewardship\, operations\, financial procedures\, programs
  and overall performance to cultivate substantial and sustainable growth o
 f Atlanta’s iconic Piedmont Park\, which is the heart and soul of the ci
 ty.\n\nSchedule of Brown Bag Speakers Spring 2020 [1]\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http

 Pless is a highly regarded specialty structural engineering firm founded i
 n 1964 in Atlanta. Over the past 55 years\, the firm has developed a reput
 ation for being industry leaders in the niche markets in which it has chos
 en to practice\, rather than evolving into a traditional large generalist 
 structural engineering firm. As a result of this focus\, the firm has deve
 loped specialized skills and attracted highly experienced engineers. This 
 has resulted in being called upon to execute more complex structural engin
 eering projects.\n\nThe firm has offices in multiple states in the US\, bu
 t provides specialty services across the country and internationally. Benn

 ly\nGraduating global citizens is one of Georgia Tech’s strategic goals\
 , yet many students don’t have the opportunity to study abroad. What are
  we doing at home to help students engage in global challenges and develop
  intercultural communication skills? In this workshop\, we invite particip
 ants to consider how integrating the United Nations Sustainable Developmen
 t Goals (SDGs) into their courses will help foster global citizenship no m
 atter where students are learning. The UN SDGs [1] are a set of 17 broad a
 nd interconnected goals that address the global challenges we face. We arg
 ue that the SDGs can be incorporated into any course regardless of discipl
 ine. Faculty members from diverse programs at Georgia Tech will share exam
 ples of how they have incorporated the SDGs into their courses. Workshop p
 articipants will have the opportunity to articulate their vision for how t
 he SDGs may work in their own course and identify (and propose) resources 
 that can help support them in realizing it.\n\nWorkshop facilitators:\n\n-

 , Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\nStatus: review\n\nAbstract:\n
 \nImagine a 1D curve\, then use it to fill a 2D manifold that covers an ar
 bitrary 3D object – this computationally intensive materials challenge h
 as been realized in the ancient technology known as knitting. This process
  for making functional materials 2D materials from 1D portable cloth dates
  back to prehistory\, with the oldest known examples dating from the 11th 
 century BCE. Knitted textiles are ubiquitous as they are easy and cheap to
  create\, lightweight\, portable\, flexible and stretchy. As with many fun
 ctional materials\, the key to knitting’s extraordinary properties lies 
 in its microstructure.\n\nAt the 1D level\, knits are composed of an inter
 locking series of slip knots. At the most basic level there is only one ma
 nipulation that creates a knitted stitch – pulling a loop of yarn throug
 h another loop. However\, there exist hundreds of books with thousands of 
 patterns of stitches with seemingly unbounded complexity.\n\nThe topology 
 of knitted stitches has a profound impact on the geometry and elasticity o
 f the resulting fabric. This puts a new spin on additive manufacturing –
  not only can stitch pattern control the local and global geometry of a te
 xtile\, but the creation process encodes mechanical properties within the 
 material itself. Unlike standard additive manufacturing techniques\, the i
 nnate properties of the yarn and the stitch microstructure has a direct ef
 fect on the global geometric and mechanical outcome of knitted fabrics.\n\
 nSpeaker Bio:\n\nElisabetta Matsumoto is an assistant professor in the Sch
 ool of Physics at Georgia Institute of Technology. Her physics research ce
 nters around the relationship between geometry and material properties in 
 soft systems\, including liquid crystals\, 3D printing and textiles. She i
 s also interested in using sewing\, 3D printing and virtual reality in mat
 hematical art and education. She is the recipient of an NSF CAREER award. 
 She studied physics at the University of Pennsylvania\, earning her BA and
  MS in 2007 and her PhD in 2011. She has been knitting and crochet since s
 he was about 12 and has been sewing for longer than she can remember.\n\nS

 oes S&T expertise get into the policy process?\n● Can a good scientist o
 r engineer be a good policymaker?\n● What strategies and tactics can Tec
 h students and alumni use to have more impact?\n\nAfter graduating from Ge
 orgia Tech (Physics)\, Professor Barke earned a Ph.D. in Political Science
  from the University of Rochester. He has advised agencies in the U.S. and
  abroad\, the U.S. Congress\, and companies on how to incorporate expert s
 cientific advice into public policy. In this lecture\, he shares what he h
 as learned over the years about the effectiveness of scientists in politic
 al arenas. Examples include cases from FDA\, EPA\, FCC\, NASA\, and the U.
 S. Congress. Professor Barke’s research focuses on the roles of politics
  within science and of science within politics\, and the regulation of ris
 k (particularly the FDA). Dr. Barke has written about topics such as the p
 olitical behavior of scientific disciplines\, the politics of science budg
 eting in Congress\, and how scientists translate scientific findings into 
 policy recommendations. Recent works involve the decision making processes
  by which science and ethics are reconciled in the regulation of research\
 , particularly research involving human subjects and in nanotechnology. Cu
 rrently he is writing a book about political\, cognitive\, and economic ob
 stacles to long-term policy making.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.edu/n

 nThere is increasing excitement about reinforcement learning--a subarea of
  machine learning for enabling an agent to learn to make good decisions. Y
 et numerous questions and challenges remain for reinforcement learning to 
 help support progress in applications that involve interacting with people
 \, like education\, consumer marketing and healthcare. I will discuss our 
 work on some of the technical challenges that arise in this pursuit\, incl
 uding sample efficiency\, counterfactual reasoning\, robustness\, and appl
 ications to health and education.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\nEmma Brunskill is an 
 assistant professor in the Computer Science Department at Stanford Univers
 ity where she leads the AI for Human Impact group. Her work focuses on rei
 nforcement learning in high stakes scenarios--how can an agent learn from 
 experience to make good decisions when experience is costly or risky\, suc
 h as in educational software\, healthcare decision making\, or people-faci
 ng applications. She was previously a professor at Carnegie Mellon Univers
 ity. She is the recipient of multiple early faculty career awards (Nationa
 l Science Foundation\, Office of Naval Research\, Microsoft Research) and 
 her group has received several best research paper nominations (CHI\, EDMx
 3) and awards (UAI\, RLDM).\n\nSchedule of Brown Bag Speakers Spring 2020

 tance of Manganese oxides in carbon remineralization in river-dominated co

 7th at 1 pm in Ford EST L1114. My committee members include Dr. Martial Ta
 illefert (advisor\, GT EAS)\, Dr. Yuanzhi Tang (GT\, EAS) Dr. Thomas DiChr
 istina (GT\, BIO)\, Dr. Frank Stewart (Montana State University)\, Dr. Geo
 rge Luther (Univ. of Delaware)\, and Dr. Christophe Rabouille (Univ d'Sacl
 ay\, CEA\, LSCE\, France). My abstract is included below.\n\nBest regards\
 ,\n\nShannon Owings\n\nManganese oxides (MnO2) are ubiquitous in the envir
 onment and play an important role in the transformation and transport of c
 ontaminants in the environment in addition to play a major role in the bio
 geochemical cycling of carbon. This study investigated both aspects of the
 se roles using a combination of laboratory experiments and field work. Fir
 st\, the kinetics of oxidation of the more toxic arsenic form\, arsenite (
 As(III))\, to the less mobile form\, arsenate (As(V))\, by MnO2 was determ
 ined and compared to literature data to investigate the mechanism of the r
 eaction. Subsequently\, the effect of low As(V) concentrations on the anae
 robic microbial respiration of MnO2 and iron oxides\, Fe(OH)3\, were inves
 tigated to shed light into the mechanism of As(V) toxicity in aquatic envi
 ronments. At low As(V) concentrations\, microbial reduction rates were inc
 reased compared to arsenic-free treatments suggesting As(V) at low concent
 rations stimulates metal reduction (MnO2\, Fe(OH)3) in sediments as a resu
 lt of a catalytic cycle in which arsenic is constantly reduced via microbi
 al detoxification and re-oxidized by MnO2. The cumulative findings from th
 is study suggest that arsenic is not simply immobilized in sediments and t
 hat a suite of complex abiotic and microbial processes including adsorptio
 n\, intracellular transport\, and redox reactions may affect the transport
  of arsenic in the environment\, and ultimately the quality of drinking wa
 ter resources.\n\nIn parallel to laboratory experiments\, manganese cyclin
 g\, and the dominant redox pathways involved in carbon remineralization pr
 ocesses were characterized in marine sediments across the Louisiana shelf 
 and slope that are exposed to mineral and terrestrial organic inputs from 
 the Mississippi River. Although sulfate reduction dominates on the contine
 ntal shelf\, denitrification and microbial manganese reduction appear equa
 lly significant anaerobic respiration processes along the continental slop
 e the closest to the Mississippi River. This study emphasizes how the diff
 erential oxidation kinetics of Mn2+ (slow) and Fe2+ (fast) as well as sedi
 ment transport processes influence the main pathways of carbon degradation
  in these regions. Overall this thesis emphasizes the importance of charac
 terizing the fundamental molecular processes of complex systems to better 
 understand large scale global biogeochemical cycles.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http:

 ity\n\nAbstract:\n\n-----------\n\nHumans have an inherent understanding o
 f the shape of their environment and the objects contained in it. Given a 
 description of a room\, a person can understand a reasonable approximation
  of the space and the objects. However\, our current methods lack this typ
 e of contextual understanding (i.e. a chair is shaped a particular way and
  indicates you can sit on it). This work is motivated by the idea that the
 re is an inherent relationship between 3D information such as shape and sc
 ene understanding/object classification. Objects such as tables\, chairs\,
  and cups have a specific shape and our models should leverage and learn t
 hat information. Depth and surface normals have frequently been used as ad
 ditional signals in semantic labeling work\; however\, there is still limi
 ted understanding on using and learning shape and labels jointly. Our work
  examines using 3D cues for unsupervised and supervised approaches for seg
 mentation and semantic labeling. We show how to use 3D information for rob
 ust unsupervised segmentation\, supervised semantic labeling using segment
 ation\, and unsupervised object categorization. We explore this relationsh
 ip further by showing how shape helps deep neural networks semantically la
 bel indoor environments. We explore how joint estimation of shape and labe
 ls improves both results when learned together and how they can both be do
 ne with little added model capacity.\n\nThis defense aims to demonstrate h
 ow 3D cues may be used to improve semantic labeling and object classificat
 ion. Specifically\, we will consider depth\, surface normals\, object clas
 sification\, and pixel-wise semantic labeling in this work. The works outl
 ined aim to validate the following thesis statement: Shape is used as an a

 \nOptimization over the Diffeomorphism Group Using Riemannian BFGS with Ap
 plication\nAbstract. The set of diffeomorphisms of the unit interval\, or 
 “warping functions\,” plays an important role in many in functional da
 ta analysis applications. Most prominently\, the problem of registering\, 
 or aligning\, pairs of functions depends on solving for an element of the 
 diffeomorphism group that\, when applied to one function\, optimally align
 s it to the other. The registration problem is posed as the unconstrained 
 minimization of a cost function over the infinite dimensional diffeomorphi
 sm function space. We make use of its well-known Riemannian geometry – t
 he positive orthant of the unit Hilbert sphere under the L2 metric – to 
 implement an efficient\, limited memory Riemannian BFGS optimization schem
 e. We compare performance and results to the benchmark algorithm\, Dynamic
  Programming\, on several functional datasets. Additionally\, we apply our
  methodology to the problem of non-parametric density estimation and compa
 re to the benchmark performance of MATLAB’s built-in kernel density esti
 mator ‘ksdensity’.\n\nBiography.\n\nDarshan Bryner received his B.S. d
 egree in Applied Mathematics in 2007 and his M.S. degree in Mathematics in
  2008\, both from Georgia Institute of Technology. In 2008\, he joined the
  Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) as a researc
 h scientist. While employed at NSWC PCD\, in 2010 he began work on his Ph.
 D. degree in Statistics at Florida State University and graduated in 2013.
  Under the co-advisement of Dr. Anuj Srivastava and Dr. Eric Klassen\, his
  thesis was on developing affine invariant\, elastic shape models to use a
 s prior distributions in a Bayesian active contour method for sonar image 
 segmentation. Dr. Bryner continues his research at NSWC PCD in a variety o
 f areas including Riemannian geometry and manifold optimization\, Bayesian
  inference in spatial statistics\, and bioinformatics. Since 2017\, Dr. Br
 yner has served as the head of the Advanced Signal Processing and Automati
 c Target Recognition Branch (Code X23) within the Science and Technology D
 epartment at NSWC PCD.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.edu/node/632525#0\

 n\nPlease register [1] to attend this upcoming teaching with technology wo
 rkshop!\n\nEvery semester we engage Georgia Tech students in a variety of 
 assessment experiences that are intended to determine what they have learn
 ed. For a number of these students\, however\, our assessments fall short 
 of their goal. Whether it’s due to language differences or to the fact t
 hat their brains are wired differently\, many students don’t get a chanc
 e to fully demonstrate what they know—and we don’t get a chance to fin
 d out the impact of our teaching.\n\nHow common is this experience? It may
  surprise you to learn that neurodivergent-related accommodations are now 
 the most frequent accommodation type at Georgia Tech. Regardless of whethe
 r you’re teaching to the highly diverse student population of an online 
 at-scale course or you’re teaching a small class of residential students
 \, you are likely to encounter students who require more diversity in asse
 ssment if you want to truly evaluate their learning experience.\n\nAlthoug
 h the thought of providing multiple types of assessments can be overwhelmi
 ng\, technology can be a great help. In this workshop\, we will explore a 
 variety of technologies such as Gradescope and Kaltura that will make it e
 asier for you to create\, collect\, and provide feedback on assessments th
 at allow for multiple means of action and expression. We will discuss how 
 the principles of Universal Design for Learning (UDL) can aid us in creati
 ng assessments that allow every student to demonstrate their learning. And
  we will hear from hear from Anne Jannarone\, Assistant Dean and Director 
 of the Office of Disability Services\, about neurodivergent students at Ge
 orgia Tech and what resources are available to you.\n\nJoin us and learn f
 irst-hand about multiple means of assessment and the technologies that mak
 e this process possible. Bring your laptop to explore examples during hand
 s-on activities\, or simply follow along with someone at your table. Wheth
 er you’re teaching large diverse populations in the online OMS program o
 r an array of students in a face-to-face course on campus\, there are ways
  that both you and your students can benefit from multiple means of assess
 ment. We look forward to seeing you at the workshop!\n\nLunch will be prov
 ided. Please register [1] [2] to join us!\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech

  Seminar\, Dr. Andrew Dickerson\, University of Central Florida\nNatural s
 ystems often inspire new methods by which to control fluids\, or conversel
 y use fluids to control systems. Three fluid mechanic systems that might c
 ome to mind include: the jetting of microdroplets when peeling an orange\,
  the droplet ejection off of a mosquito wing\, and the splash suppression 
 provided by floating toilet paper during defecation. These phenomena at th
 e interface of biology and fluid mechanics can provide engineers with usef
 ul\, inspired information for future designs. Here we study the explosive 
 dispersal of oil emitted from ‘cracked’ glands in the peels of citrus 
 fruit. The jetting oil undergoes an extreme acceleration to reach velociti
 es in excess of 10 m/s. On a slightly larger scale\, the method mosquitoes
  use to ‘buzz’ their wings free of deposited water drops prompts a loo
 k into how flexible surfaces may be vibrated to self-dry. We find drop eje
 ction is dependent on drop and wing properties\, and wing motion in this h
 ighly-coupled system. On yet a larger scale\, the dynamics of the entry of
  solids into liquid baths\, such as the ‘plop’ of restroom use\, is he
 avily influenced by free surface conditions\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gate

 ay\n\nRobotic systems have been very successful in performing tasks where 
 the inputs are well defined and known in advance. Automotive and electroni
 c manufacturing are the classic success stories where robotic systems have
  demonstrated incredible value for the industry. In unstructured manufactu
 ring\, the inputs of the system can vary significantly\, but the outputs o
 f the system are defined. Food and agriculture production are examples of 
 this type of unstructured manufacturing problem\, but traditional manufact
 uring is also moving in this direction as robotics move beyond welding and
  painting. This presentation will give examples of systems that integrate 
 advanced perception and control technologies into robotic systems to perfo
 rm complex tasks like cutting\, grasping\, and manipulation of objects in 
 an unstructured environment.\n\nRegister Online for upcoming SCL IRC semin

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Public\
 , Undergraduate students\nExtras: Free food\nStatus: published\n\nAbstract
 :\n\nWords are always spoken and understood in context. Linguists\, psycho
 logists and computer scientists have recognized this when they defined wor
 d meaning using their aggregate linguistic contexts across large samples. 
 Early examples include Latent Semantic Indexing (Landauer & Dumais 1997)\,
  while recently\, some computational models have become vastly successful 
 in NLP\, such as Word2Vec (Mikolov et al\, 2013) or BERT (Devlin et al.\, 
 2018).\n\nHowever\, when young children learn to speak\, they refer to a m
 uch richer context than language alone. Their parents expose them to a ric
 h visual world\, and that is also a common context for adult language use.
  In this talk\, I argue that modern models for commonsense reasoning and n
 atural language processing should therefore learn from visual and linguist
 ic data.\n\nI will present two examples of multimodal neural models that c
 an bring together visual and linguistic context. One is a language model t
 hat predicts next words better when trained on image embeddings in additio
 n to their captions (Ororbia et al.\, ACL 2019). The other is a BERT-based
  model that set a new state-of-the-art in visual commonsense reasoning\, c
 hoosing answers to questions about movie stills and also giving a reason f
 or these answers (Alberti et al.\, EMNLP 2019). It is pre-trained on a WWW
  corpus of images and ALT tags (texts added for accessibility purposes) be
 fore learning to answer questions about the movie screenshots.\n\nSpeaker 
 Bio:\n\nDavid Reitter is a senior research scientist at Google Research\, 
 New York City\, where he works on modeling conversational and multimodal i
 nteraction using very large-scale data. Until recently\, he was an associa
 te professor of information sciences at Penn State. There\, his research g
 roup carried out NSF-funded research on computational models of human cogn
 ition. David did his postdoc in psychology at Carnegie Mellon University a
 nd holds a PhD in informatics from the University of Edinburgh (2008).\n\n

 ulty who serve on reappointment\, promotion\, and/or tenure committees and
  faculty search committees are required to participate in an Implicit Bias
  Workshop pursuant to Provost Bras’ memo in October 2016 to academic lea
 ders. However\, all instructional and research faculty are welcomed to att
 end as space permits.\n\nThe goals of these workshops are to increase awar
 eness of the impact of implicit bias and facilitate equitable decision-mak
 ing across myriad processes related to faculty evaluations. As a participa
 nt in the workshop\, you will learn the following:\n\n• An introduction 
 to the concept of implicit bias and how these unconscious\, automatic ment
 al processes may impact behaviors such as evaluating candidates during fac
 ulty search and/or RPT processes.\n\n• Empirical research on vitaes\, le
 tters of recommendations\, and teaching evaluations to illustrate the impa
 ct of implicit bias on decisions.\n\n• Effective practices and strategie
 s for faculty search and RPT committees.\n\nThese workshops will be facili
 tated by Paul Benkeser\, senior associate chair and professor\, Wallace H.
  Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering\; Harris Dimitropoulos\, ass
 ociate professor\, School of Architecture\; Robert Kirkman\, associate pro

 . and globally. UA and SC research has helped developed powerful technique
 s for spatial data creation\, capture and analysis and has drawn talented 
 individuals to this research.\n\nYet\, these programs and research agendas
  often operate without an explicit ‘plan’ for how technology and data 
 analysis will tackle real world issues. Because these fields are founded w
 ith technocratic and engineering problem-solving ideals (values inherent t
 o analytics and ‘smart’ endeavors)\, research questions and execution 
 in this field may be need re-definition and intervention if they are to he
 lp cities reach the most vulnerable citizens and improve daily life. Resea
 rch and thought leadership in UA and SC should include the voices and inpu
 t of the typical urbanite and those most in need. This field also should d
 eeply consider how different perspectives on race\, ethnicity\, gender\, s
 exual-orientation\, disability and poverty status (and more) may add cruci
 al variables to the study of urban analytics.\n\nResearch Contribution\nWe
  will be generating solutions for how our research and teaching can includ
 e a more diverse body of tacit knowledge from the urban community and how 
 can we solve real-life problems with data analytics. We will be developing
  strategies and recommending formal research frameworks (mixed-method\, mu
 lti-scale\, validating-by-interview\, etc.) to guide UA and SC research to
 wards championing citizen voices and helping people. Our goal is to empowe
 r UA students and researchers to shape urban research questions\, methodol
 ogies and implementation in way that positively impacts the city and its p
 eople.\n\nWe will have meaningful conversations and develop a guiding agen
 da that can serve as an ‘intervention’ that is needed as UA and SC fie
 lds mature. Without this discussion\, these fields may not adopt the kinds
  of sensitivities towards diversity\, inclusion and the human experience\,
  that it needs to best serve the people. The agenda will help put forth:\n
 \n- A plan to put crucial information into the hands of the city’s most 
 vulnerable populations.\n- Methods for using technology to collect data on
  spatial behaviors in a safe\, privacy-securing way\, and using the inform
 ation to optimize locations of services and facilities.\n- Designs for tec
 h education for disadvantaged and underrepresented populations at multiple
  levels.\n- Methods to identify which small changes can have the biggest i
 mpact.\n- How to listen to and learn from citizens who need help and have 
 first-hand perspectives (i.e. tacit knowledge) on the urban ecosystem.\n- 
 Open ended discussion on how to connect urban analytics to common-sense ur
 ban problems.\n\nActivities\nOur panel sessions will contain five speakers
  each\, and will include a mixture of visuals and oral presentations.\n\nB
 reakout sessions will divide our participants into 3 groups. The topics wi
 ll be formed by our set of distinguished breakout leaders and can be adjus
 ted to reflect the pressing needs of the day.\n\nPanelists\, breakout lead
 ers and the keynote & closing speakers will be announced at a later date.\

 ound\nUrban Analytics (UA) and Smart Cities (SC) degree programs are becom
 ing more common in the U.S. and globally. Often\, these programs don’t h
 ave a ‘plan’ for how technology and data analysis will tackle real wor
 ld issues\, or an understanding of how different perspectives on race\, et
 hnicity\, gender\, sexual-orientation\, disability and poverty status (and
  more) may add crucial variables to the study of urban analytics.\n\nAltho
 ugh the UA field is data-rich\, the questions and studies in this field ma
 y be ill-suited for helping cities reach the most vulnerable citizens\, or
  how to best empower UA students to positively impact to the city and its 
 people. Because these fields were founded with technocratic and engineerin
 g problem-solving ideals (values inherent to analytics and ‘smart’ end
 eavors)\, the research and thought leadership in UA ad SC lacks the voices
  and input of the typical urbanite and those most in need\, although it co
 ntributes powerful methods and draws talent.\n\nResearch Contribution\nWe 
 will be generating solutions for how our research and teaching can include
  a more diverse body of tacit knowledge from the urban community and how c
 an we solve real-life problems with data analytics? We will be developing 
 strategies and recommending formal research frameworks (mixed-method\, mul

 gan ADVANCE Program\, 2001-2016\, before which she held a number of other 
 administrative positions. She holds degrees from Wesleyan University\, Lon
 don School of Economics\, and Harvard University. Her current research foc
 uses on academic and life experiences related to race\, class and gender\,
  and on political attitudes and activision.\n\nDr. Stewart's recent book\,
  with Virginia Valian\, is called An Inclusive Academy: Achieving Diversit
 y and Excellence (MIT Press\, 2018):\n\nHow colleges and universities can 
 live up to their ideals of diversity\, and why inclusivity and excellence 
 go hand in hand.\n\nMost colleges and universities embrace the ideals of d
 iversity and inclusion\, but many fall short\, especially in the hiring\, 
 retention\, and advancement of faculty who would more fully represent our 
 diverse world—in particular women and people of color. In this book\, Ab
 igail Stewart and Virginia Valian argue that diversity and excellence go h
 and in hand and provide guidance for achieving both.\n\nStewart and Valian
 \, themselves senior academics\, support their argument with comprehensive
  data from a range of disciplines. They show why merit is often overlooked
 \; they offer statistics and examples of individual experiences of exclusi
 on\, such as being left out of crucial meetings\; and they outline institu
 tional practices that keep exclusion invisible\, including reliance on pro
 xies for excellence\, such as prestige\, that disadvantage outstanding can
 didates who are not members of the white male majority.\n\nPerhaps most im
 portant\, Stewart and Valian provide practical advice for overcoming obsta
 cles to inclusion. This advice is based on their experiences at their own 
 universities\, their consultations with faculty and administrators at many
  other institutions\, and data on institutional change. Stewart and Valian
  offer recommendations for changing structures and practices so that peopl
 e become successful in ways that benefit everyone. They describe better wa
 ys of searching for job candidates\; evaluating candidates for hiring\, te
 nure\, and promotion\; helping faculty succeed\; and broadening rewards an
 d recognition.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.edu/node/633364#0

 \, Public\, Undergraduate students\nStatus: published\n\nOverheating light
 ing instruments coupled with human error are a leading cause of intraopera
 tive fires and patient burns. The healthcare system refers to these as “
 never events” so they should never happen\, right? But\, data suggests t
 hat they occur more than twice a day. This was a red flag for Jackson Medi
 cal Co-founders James Rains and Kamil Makhnejia.\n\nAt the Georgia Institu
 te of Technology\, Rains and Makhnejia began conceptualizing GloShield™ 
 to address this safety issue. They then brought on to the team Dr. Spencer
  Kozin\, a local Atlanta urologist\, who not only resonated with the safet
 y issue being addressed\, but also provided clinical expertise to the team
 .\n\nTogether\, the future Jackson Medical team knew they had a great base
  concept but to successfully commercialize the idea\, they would need an a
 dditional outside design and development perspective. “We knew that we h
 ad an innovative concept and that there is nothing like GloShield currentl
 y on the market\, but needed to ensure that we were taking the correct ste
 ps that would help us reach commercialization in a timely and cost-efficie
 nt manner\,” Rains said.\n\nProfessor Rains\, Dr. Kozin\, Mr. Makhnejia 
 will discuss the questions researchers and innovators must answer and what
  they should anticipate from a funding and development timeline standpoint
  at the earliest stages of the pathway in their medical product concept’
 s journey toward commercialization.\n\nLunch will be provided free of char

 ve been very successful in performing tasks where the inputs are well defi
 ned and known in advance. Automotive and electronic manufacturing are the 
 classic success stories where robotic systems have demonstrated incredible
  value for the industry. In unstructured manufacturing\, the inputs of the
  system can vary significantly\, but the outputs of the system are defined
 . Food and agriculture production are examples of this type of unstructure
 d manufacturing problem\, but traditional manufacturing is also moving in 
 this direction as robotics move beyond welding and painting. This presenta
 tion will give examples of systems that integrate advanced perception and 
 control technologies into robotic systems to perform complex tasks like cu
 tting\, grasping\, and manipulation of objects in an unstructured environm

 \nComposite Materials: The growing pains of a "young technology" destined 
 for a very bright future\n\nComposites are a young and unique class of mat
 erials that provide engineering freedom and integration of parts and funct
 ions. In the last 30 years\, composites have evolved from niche to mainstr
 eam thanks to major advances in chemistry\, material science and automatio
 n. However\, the industry is still not extracting the full potential of th
 e technology to maximize performance\, increase production rates and reduc
 e total cost of ownership. The future widespread adoption of composites ac
 ross multiple markets will be driven by innovations in high throughput man
 ufacturing\, multi-functionality\, environmental sustainability\, simulati
 on and modelling.\n\nDate: Friday\, April 17th\nTime: 11AM – 12:15 PM (l
 unch following in the GTMI atrium)\nLocation:\nGTMI Auditorium #101\nGeorg

 pace Materials from 2010 to 2014 and Product Development Director from 200
 5 to 2010. Early in his career\, Lo Faro had leadership roles in R&D\, Eng
 ineering\, and Operational Improvement and was instrumental in introducing
  novel advanced materials and processes on multiple aerospace\, defense an
 d automotive programs. He holds nine international patents and has authore
 d several technical papers. He serves on the Board of Governors of the Aer
 ospace Industry Association and the Board of Directors of JEC.\n\nLo Faro

 rof. Marilyn Smith]\n\nwill defend a doctoral thesis entitled\,\n\nA Refin
 ed Potential Theory for the Incompressible Unsteady Subcritical-Reynolds n
 umber Flows on Canonical Bluff Bodies\n\nOn\n\nTuesday\, May 5 at 2:00 p.m
 .\nBluejeans: [1]\n\nAbstract\n\nClassical potential theory falls short of
  reconciling the actions of fluid viscosity and frictional forces in an ac
 tual flow with the theoretical analysis of such a flow. As such\, it is un
 able to predict the important phenomenon of flow separation that leads\, i
 n part\, to the pressure drag experienced by the body in an actual flow. H
 owever\, analytical solutions that theories provide offer huge advantages 
 over numerical and experimental solutions in the understanding of fluid fl
 ows and in design. These are in terms of cost and time consumption.\n\nThe
 refore\, a refinement of Classical potential theory of the flow over a cir
 cular cylinder was carried out to bridge this gap. It was achieved by intr
 oducing a viscous sink-source-vortex sheet on the surface of the cylinder.
  These singularities are modeled as concentric at every location. The vort
 ices are modeled as Burgers vortices\, and analytic expressions for their 
 strengths and those of the sinks/sources are obtained from the classical t
 heory. These are employed to obtain a Reynolds-number-and-time-dependent s
 tream function that captures important qualitative features of the flow. A
  viscous potential function that satisfies the governing equations is then
  derived. It is obtained by defining the viscous stream function on a prin
 cipal axis of the flow about which the vorticity vector is identically zer
 o. Strategies have also been developed to account for the finite extent of
  the cylinder\, to introduce dynamic unsteadiness\, to predict separation/
 reattachment/transition\, to obtain forces\, and to apply the solution to 
 an arbitrary geometry with a focus on spheres and spheroids.\n\nThe refine
 d potential theory was verified against experimental and numerical data on
  the cylinder in an incompressible crossflow at. Its drag prediction is wi
 thin the error bound of measured data. The prediction of other quantities 
 is also within acceptable ranges. Its prediction of the force coefficients
  over the range was validated against experimental data on the cylinder in
  crossflow. There is a good agreement in the trend with slight disparity i
 n magnitude that is in favor of safety for design purposes. The energy spe
 ctra of the wake velocity display the Kolmogorov's Five-Thirds law of homo
 geneous isotropic turbulence. This verifies and validates the unsteadiness
  in refined potential theory as turbulent in nature.\n\nCommittee\n\n- Pro

 ents\nStatus: published\n\nOverview\nDr. Benoit Montreuil [01] will emphas
 ize the impactful interplay between supply chains and pandemics\, across t
 he world and in each locality. The impact of collectively improving pandem
 ic supply chain readiness and response in each of the five world states - 
 healthy\, outbreak\, epidemics\, pandemics\, and recovery - will be highli
 ghted.\n\nThe focus will be on critical and essential supply chains to dem
 onstrate the capital importance of supply chains in fighting and surviving
  a pandemics\, as revealed by the COVID-19 crisis.\n\n- Critical supply ch
 ains support the fight against the pandemic disease by supporting the boom
 ing demand for testing kits\, masks\, respirators\, etc.\, to hospitals an
 d health centers.\n- Essential supply chains provide the food\, health pro
 ducts and goods necessary to ensure survival\, quality of life and recover
 y capability of pandemic-affected populations and economies\, notably subj
 ect to distancing and containment measures.\n\nKey avenues for collectivel
 y and comprehensively enabling effective and efficient pandemic supply cha
 in readiness and response in each of the world states will be presented. T
 hese avenues combine common-sense pragmatic practices to leading-edge conc
 epts and technologies\, notably based on Artificial Intelligence and the P
 hysical Internet. They notably enable:\n\n- Critical and essential supply 
 chain visibility and predictability\;\n- Smart fair decisions relative to 
 critical and essential product allocation\, deployment\, and transportatio
 n\;\n- Keeping a healthy and efficient supply chain workforce\;\n- Repurpo
 sing supply chains and facilities to provide boost in critical and essenti
 al product availability\;\n- Vector-free logistics eliminating disease pro
 pagation through goods and food production\, packaging\, distribution and 
 delivery.\n\nThe presentation results from the interdisciplinary collabora

  with the same interactive components.\n\nCourse Description\nMeeting dema
 nd in a timely and cost-effective manner is important both in public and p
 rivate supply chains\, and heavily depend on the design and operation of t
 hese supply chains. Demand is affected by ongoing factors such as local ec
 onomy\, infrastructure\, and geographic location\, as well as unexpected e
 vents such as natural or manmade disasters or other large-scale disruption
 s. Designing and operating responsive supply chains requires the considera
 tion of uncertainty in timing\, scope\, scale\, and understanding of vario
 us topics such as forecasting\, distribution network design\, and inventor
 y management. This course will examine methods and models for making suppl
 y chain design and operational decisions and explore the significant value
  that is obtained through informed decision-making in advance of an unpred
 ictable event or long-term strategy for meeting the need of customers and 
 beneficiaries.\n\nWho Should Attend\nThis course is designed for represent
 atives from governmental or non-governmental organizations\, private corpo
 rations\, military\, and foundations\, including but not limited to senior
  executives overseeing administrative and operational functions of an orga
 nization\, logistics and supply chain managers\, program managers\, direct
 ors of field operations\, directors of emergency/disaster preparedness and
  response\, and public health professionals.\n\nHow You Will Benefit\n- Pr
 ovide immediate impact to your organization through learnings gained from 
 applied and real-world case studies.\n- Learn to bring NGOs\, businesses\,
  or government entities together to enhance collaboration\, cooperation\, 
 and communication.\n- Discover current trends and procedures to help organ
 izations and team members get and stay ahead of the curve.\n- Build a crit
 ical knowledge base to make tactical decisions around inventory\, routing\
 , and distribution.\n- Deliver best practices to measure and evaluate the 
 efficiency\, impact\, and outcomes of focused initiatives or ongoing logis
 tics and supply chain operations.\n- Transform the health and humanitarian
  sectors with increased capacity to participate in planning and strategic 
 decision-making for effective supply-chain management.\n\nWhat Is Covered\

 nWhat Is Juneteenth?\nThis story by Elixabeth Nix was originally published
  on History.com. [5] The story has been adapted for the College of Science
 s.\n\nJuneteenth (short for "June Nineteenth") marks the day when federal 
 troops arrived in Galveston\, Texas in 1865 to take control of the state a
 nd ensure that all enslaved people be freed. The troops' arrival came a fu
 ll two and a half years after signing the Emancipation Proclamation. Junet
 eenth honors the end to slavery in the United States and is considered the
  longest-running African American holiday.\n\nConfederate General Robert E
 . Lee had surrendered at Appomattox Court House two months earlier in Virg
 inia\, but slavery had remained relatively unaffected in Texas - until U.S
 . General Gordon Granger stood on Texas soil and read General Orders No. 3
 : "The people of Texas are informed that\, in accordance with a proclamati
 on from the Executive of the United States\, all slaves are free."\n\nRead

  taught by LIVE video instruction similar to the experience you would rece

 nOften the lack of cooperation and coordination between organizations or s
 takeholders lead to inefficiencies\, despite having common goals. A system
 s view is needed to ensure appropriate use of scarce resources to meet the
  multiple\, and often conflicting\, short- and long-term goals from multip
 le constituents. This course will focus on conceptual and modeling skills 
 to understand and effectively manage supply chains and operations from a s
 ystems perspective. Models will address system characteristics (e.g.\, dem
 and dependencies) that drive system dynamics and policies to regulate perf
 ormance. Course topics include methods for improving coordination and coll

SUMMARY:Assistant Professor Levi Wood: Systems Analysis of Neural Immune S
 ignaling in Neurodegenerative Diseases
DTSTART;TZID=UTC;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20200730T200000Z
DTEND;TZID=UTC;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20200730T210000Z

DESCRIPTION:Status: unknown\n\nDysregulated neural immune activity contrib
 utes to the pathogenesis of diverse diseases\, including Alzheimer’s dis
 ease\, traumatic brain injury\, and lysosomal storage disorders\, among ot
 hers. Understanding neural immune function and identification of strategie
 s to restore healthy or homeostatic immune activity holds the potential to
  transform our ability to treat neurodegenerative diseases. Neural immune 
 activity is a complex system\, consisting of intracellular regulation of d
 iverse immune genes by phospho-signaling cascades that ultimately control 
 glial phenotypes and expression of extra-cellular signaling factors\, such
  as cytokines\, that communicate between cells and exacerbate dysfunction.
  This talk will consist of two parts.\n\nIn the first part\, I will discus
 s our work\, in collaboration with Dr. Amit Reddi\, to illuminate the role
  of the blood factors heme and hemoglobin in potentiating Alzheimer’s di
 sease pathogenesis. We have found that elevation of these factors in Alzhe
 imer’s disease suppresses immune function of the brain’s immune cells\
 , astrocytes and microglia\, including their abilities to clear amyloid be
 ta\, which is the hallmark protein that forms plaques in Alzheimer’s bra
 ins. By integrating extracellular (cytokine) and intracellular (phospho-pr
 otein) signaling data\, we have determined that heme and hemoglobin attenu
 ate normal immune function by stimulating the PI3K/Akt pathway. Moreover\,
  attenuation of the heme biosynthetic pathway reduced amyloid beta patholo
 gy in 5xFAD Alzheimer’s disease mice. Together\, these data illuminate a
 n entirely new aspect of Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis and suggest a 
 novel mechanism resulting in brain immune cell “fatigue\,” which may b
 e treated by attenuating heme synthesis.\n\nIn the second part\, I will di
 scuss our work to identify neuroinflammatory signaling responsible for cog
 nitive deficit after repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). We use
  a weight drop closed head injury mouse model relevant to sports injury in
  which a subset of mice experience cognitive deficit despite having no ove
 rt signs of neuronal injury. Using a non-invasive optical cerebral blood f
 low sensor\, we found that mice with acutely low cerebral blood flow after
  mTBI would suffer long term memory deficit and had elevated acute microgl
 ial activation. Surprisingly\, microglial activation was accompanied by ne
 uronal pro-inflammatory phospho-signaling and cytokine expression\, sugges
 ting for the first time that neural immunity and cognitive deficit depends
  on the interplay between glia and neurons. Moreover\, our ongoing studies
  suggest that inhibition of phospho-signaling using translationally releva
 nt small molecules has the potential to restore cognitive function after r
 epetitive mTBI.\n\nDr. Wood has been an assistant professor in the Institu
 te for Bioengineering and Bioscience at Georgia Tech since August 2015. He
  completed his PhD at MIT where he developed novel microfluidics to identi
 fy mechanisms governing blood vessel geometry during angiogenesis. For his
  postdoc\, Levi\, joined the signaling systems biology laboratories of Kev
 in Haigis and Douglas Lauffenburger at MGH and MIT. While there\, he used 
 engineering systems methods to identify new mechanisms of cell death in Al

SUMMARY:Asst. Professor Levi Wood: Systems Analysis of Neural Immune Signa
 ling in Neurodegenerative Diseases

DESCRIPTION:Status: unknown\n\nDysregulated neural immune activity contrib
 utes to the pathogenesis of diverse diseases\, including Alzheimer’s dis
 ease\, traumatic brain injury\, and lysosomal storage disorders\, among ot
 hers. Understanding neural immune function and identification of strategie
 s to restore healthy or homeostatic immune activity holds the potential to
  transform our ability to treat neurodegenerative diseases. Neural immune 
 activity is a complex system\, consisting of intracellular regulation of d
 iverse immune genes by phospho-signaling cascades that ultimately control 
 glial phenotypes and expression of extra-cellular signaling factors\, such
  as cytokines\, that communicate between cells and exacerbate dysfunction.
  This talk will consist of two parts.\n\nIn the first part\, I will discus
 s our work\, in collaboration with Dr. Amit Reddi\, to illuminate the role
  of the blood factors heme and hemoglobin in potentiating Alzheimer’s di
 sease pathogenesis. We have found that elevation of these factors in Alzhe
 imer’s disease suppresses immune function of the brain’s immune cells\
 , astrocytes and microglia\, including their abilities to clear amyloid be
 ta\, which is the hallmark protein that forms plaques in Alzheimer’s bra
 ins. By integrating extracellular (cytokine) and intracellular (phospho-pr
 otein) signaling data\, we have determined that heme and hemoglobin attenu
 ate normal immune function by stimulating the PI3K/Akt pathway. Moreover\,
  attenuation of the heme biosynthetic pathway reduced amyloid beta patholo
 gy in 5xFAD Alzheimer’s disease mice. Together\, these data illuminate a
 n entirely new aspect of Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis and suggest a 
 novel mechanism resulting in brain immune cell “fatigue\,” which may b
 e treated by attenuating heme synthesis.\n\nIn the second part\, I will di
 scuss our work to identify neuroinflammatory signaling responsible for cog
 nitive deficit after repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). We use
  a weight drop closed head injury mouse model relevant to sports injury in
  which a subset of mice experience cognitive deficit despite having no ove
 rt signs of neuronal injury. Using a non-invasive optical cerebral blood f
 low sensor\, we found that mice with acutely low cerebral blood flow after
  mTBI would suffer long term memory deficit and had elevated acute microgl
 ial activation. Surprisingly\, microglial activation was accompanied by ne
 uronal pro-inflammatory phospho-signaling and cytokine expression\, sugges
 ting for the first time that neural immunity and cognitive deficit depends
  on the interplay between glia and neurons. Moreover\, our ongoing studies
  suggest that inhibition of phospho-signaling using translationally releva
 nt small molecules has the potential to restore cognitive function after r
 epetitive mTBI.\n\nDr. Wood has been an assistant professor in the Institu
 te for Bioengineering and Bioscience at Georgia Tech since August 2015. He
  completed his PhD at MIT where he developed novel microfluidics to identi
 fy mechanisms governing blood vessel geometry during angiogenesis. For his
  postdoc\, Levi\, joined the signaling systems biology laboratories of Kev
 in Haigis and Douglas Lauffenburger at MGH and MIT. While there\, he used 
 engineering systems methods to identify new mechanisms of cell death in Al
 zheimer’s disease and the inflamed intestine. The Wood lab combines engi
 neering systems analysis with multi-dimensional datasets from human tissue
 s\, mouse models\, and 2D and 3D cell culture models to understand the rol
 es of neural immune activity in promoting healthy brain function and in dr
 iving diverse neurological disorders. In addition to identifying underlyin
 g mechanisms of disease\, Dr. Wood has a particular interest in identifyin
 g rapidly translatable treatment approaches using re-purposed drugs for ca
 ncer and other conditions that may already be commercially available or la

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Postdoc
 \, Undergraduate students\nStatus: published\n\nLet's get together for som
 e self-care Tapping\, breathing and centering\, to better manage stress\, 
 and access more calm and clarity.\n\nWhen: Tuesdays & Thursdays in July\, 
 Noon ~ 12:30\, (August ~ TBD)\nWhere: Drop In Zoom (Initial download/setup
  might be required) [01]\nWhat: 1. Casual chat on stress & Tapping intro (
 as needed)\n2. "Tapping" similar to this video " Trauma Tapping Technique 
 [02]."\n\nThe self-help technique to be shared may provide you with some w
 ays to calm down stress and other emotions. However\, it is not a treatmen
 t or prescription for any medial or mental health issues\, nor a substitut
 e for regular medical or psychological care. If you have a medical or psyc
 hological condition\, please consult your doctor or other appropriate lice
 nsed health practitioner. Joining the Tapping session does not constitute 
 a professional relationship between the viewers and the presenters. Choosi
 ng to Tap along means you are taking responsibility for your own self. We 
 hope the session will contain some helpful information to you.\n\n- Mental

 .\, MDiv [06]\n- Video: " How to Make Stress Your Friend [07] " by Psychol
 ogist Kelly McGonigal\n".... the harmful effects of stress on your health 
 are not inevitable. How you think and how you act can transform your exper
 ience of stress. When you choose to view your stress response as helpful\,
  you create the biology of courage. And when you choose to connect with ot
 hers under stress\, you can create resilience....Stress gives us access to
  our hearts. The compassionate heart that finds joy and meaning in connect
 ing with others\, and yes\, your pounding physical heart\, working so hard
  to give you strength and energy. And when you choose to view stress in th
 is way\, you're not just getting better at stress\, you're actually making
  a pretty profound statement. You're saying that you can trust yourself to
  handle life's challenges. And you're remembering that you don't have to f
 ace them alone. "\n- Video: " First Aid for Emotional Distress - Trauma Ta

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Postdoc
 \, Undergraduate students\nStatus: draft\n\nThe build up of stress has con
 sequences for the mind and body. Poor sleep\, lack of appetite\, decreased
  productivity\, decreased immunity\, susceptibility to sickness\, are some
  of the few\, and we might find it difficult to get out of the vicious cyc
 le of stress. Except\, nowadays there are some very simple and effective w
 ays to nip the stress bud so we can prevent the over-growth! Come\, join\,
  and learn and try "Tapping" - a simple stress management method to add to
  your tool box. A brief introduction (and actually doing it) is all you ne
 ed so we can better Tap into calm. When: Noon ~ 12:30\, most Fridays start
 ing August 28.\nWhere: Drop In Zoom (Initial download/setup likely require
 d for phone/computer) [01]\nWhat: 1. "Tapping" similar to this video " Tra

  you create the biology of courage. And when you choose to connect with ot
 hers under stress\, you can create resilience....Stress gives us access to
  our hearts. The compassionate heart that finds joy and meaning in connect
 ing with others\, and yes\, your pounding physical heart\, working so hard
  to give you strength and energy. And when you choose to view stress in th
 is way\, you're not just getting better at stress\, you're actually making
  a pretty profound statement. You're saying that you can trust yourself to
  handle life's challenges. And you're remembering that you don't have to f

 nJoin the BlueJeans Meeting [1]\n\nABSTRACT\nAntarctic krill (Euphausia su
 perba) is a key component of the Antarctic food web with considerable lipi
 d reserves that are vital for both their own and higher predator survival.
  Krill feed on diatoms\, dinoflagellates and other algal species year-roun
 d\, resulting in high omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids which are essent
 ial for krill health\, growth and reproduction. Krill-derived omega-3 cont
 aining products (particularly eicosapentacnoic acid (20:5w3) and docosahex
 aenoic acid (22:6w3)) are sold as nutraceuticals for human consumption. Kr
 ill oil tablets (sold as an omega-3 supplement) are now one of the fastest
  growing nutraceuticals globally. However\, few attempts have been made to
  link the spatial and temporal variations in krill lipids to those in thei
 r food supply. Knowledge of krill diet and krill lipid dynamics is lacking
  for the Indian and Pacific Oceans\, as most studies have focused on the S
 outh Atlantic Ocean sector where the krill fishery is based. Most research
  voyages are conducted during the summer and all scientific studies are re
 stricted in their spatial and temporal scales. Another major gap in curren
 t Antarctic ecosystem models is the link between environmental drivers and
  their impact on primary production and therefore food availability. Satel
 lite-derived data for biological and ecological measures is still developi
 ng as a tool although outputs such as ocean colour data which can be conve
 rted into chlorophyll a concentrations (a proxy for primary production)\, 
 are becoming more common. This seminar will cover recent developments in t
 he knowledge of spatiotemporal fluctuations of krill lipid biochemistry in
  relation to their environment.\n\nLinks:\n[0]  http://hg.gatech.edu/node/

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Postdoc
 \, Undergraduate students\nStatus: draft\n\nThe build up of stress has con
 sequences for the mind and body. Poor sleep\, lack of appetite\, decreased
  productivity\, decreased immunity\, susceptibility to sickness\, are some
  of the few\, and we might find it difficult to get out of the vicious cyc
 le of stress. Except\, nowadays there are some very simple and effective w
 ays to nip the stress bud so we can prevent the over-growth! Come\, join\,
  and learn and try "Tapping" - a simple stress management method to add to
  your tool box. A brief introduction (and actually doing it) is all you ne
 ed so we can better Tap into calm. When: Noon ~ 12:30\, most Fridays start
 ing August 28.\nWhere: Drop In Zoom (Initial download/setup likely require
 d for phone/computer) [01]\nWhat: 1. "Tapping" similar to this video " Tra
 uma Tapping Technique [02]."\n2. Chat and Q&A (Please feel free to leave e
 arly after Tapping\, as needed\, or you are more than welcome to stay a li
 ttle longer and enjoy a Q&A and some more chat.)\n\n- Mental Health Resour

 ogist Kelly McGonigal\n".... the harmful effects of stress on your health 
 are not inevitable. How you think and how you act can transform your exper
 ience of stress. When you choose to view your stress response as helpful\,
  you create the biology of courage. And when you choose to connect with ot
 hers under stress\, you can create resilience....Stress gives us access to
  our hearts. The compassionate heart that finds joy and meaning in connect
 ing with others\, and yes\, your pounding physical heart\, working so hard
  to give you strength and energy. And when you choose to view stress in th
 is way\, you're not just getting better at stress\, you're actually making
  a pretty profound statement. You're saying that you can trust yourself to
  handle life's challenges. And you're remembering that you don't have to f
 ace them alone. "\n- Video: " First Aid for Emotional Distress - Trauma Ta

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Postdoc
 \, Undergraduate students\nStatus: draft\n\nThe build up of stress has con
 sequences for the mind and body. Poor sleep\, lack of appetite\, decreased
  productivity\, decreased immunity\, susceptibility to sickness\, are some
  of the few\, and we might find it difficult to get out of the vicious cyc
 le of stress. Except\, nowadays there are some very simple and effective w
 ays to nip the stress bud so we can prevent the over-growth! Come\, join\,
  and learn and try "Tapping" - a simple stress management method to add to
  your tool box. A brief introduction (and actually doing it) is all you ne
 ed so we can better Tap into calm. When: Noon ~ 12:30\, most Fridays start
 ing August 28.\nWhere: Drop In Zoom (Initial download/setup likely require
 d for phone/computer) [01]\nWhat: 1. "Tapping" similar to this video " Tra
 uma Tapping Technique [02]."\n2. Chat and Q&A (Please feel free to leave e

 are not inevitable. How you think and how you act can transform your exper
 ience of stress. When you choose to view your stress response as helpful\,
  you create the biology of courage. And when you choose to connect with ot
 hers under stress\, you can create resilience....Stress gives us access to
  our hearts. The compassionate heart that finds joy and meaning in connect
 ing with others\, and yes\, your pounding physical heart\, working so hard
  to give you strength and energy. And when you choose to view stress in th
 is way\, you're not just getting better at stress\, you're actually making
  a pretty profound statement. You're saying that you can trust yourself to
  handle life's challenges. And you're remembering that you don't have to f
 ace them alone. "\n- Video: " First Aid for Emotional Distress - Trauma Ta

 \, Public\, Undergraduate students\nStatus: published\n\nGordana Vunjak-No
 vakovic\, Ph.D.\nUniversity Professor\nThe Mikati Foundation Professor of 
 Biomedical Engineering and Medicine\nDirector\, Laboratory for Stem Cells 
 and Tissue Engineering\nColumbia University\n\nApproximately 35 million me
 n and women in the United States suffer from TMJ problems\, and as many as
  one in four people experience symptoms of TMJ disorders\, including pain 
 in the chewing muscles\, jaw stiffness\, clicking\, popping or grating\, o
 r the pain of arthritis. The temporomandibular joint\, or TMJ\, is the jaw
  joint that lies in front of each ear\, connecting the mandible (lower jaw
 ) to the skull\, providing the mobility necessary for biting\, chewing\, s
 wallowing food\, speaking\, and making facial expressions.\n\nGordana Vunj
 ak-Novakovic and her research team have been able to grow bone grafts that
  will match a patient’s original jaw bone for facial reconstruction surg
 ery to repair injuries\, disease\, or birth defects. This spectacular adva
 ncement in bone tissue engineering provides all the advantages of the body
 ’s original jaw bone. The team used real bone as a scaffold to grow the 
 new TMJ graft. Taking the knee joints of calves\, they stripped them of al
 l their living cells and carved them into cubic centimeter-size parts of a
  human jaw joint.\n\nUsing mesenchymal stem cells\, which can differentiat
 e into many cell types\, to seed the scaffolding\, they fed them with stre
 ams of nutrients\, growth factors\, and oxygen in a bioreactor. The next s
 tep will be to determine the best way to grow blood vessels in the bone gr
 afts to continue their viability.\n\nIn another research area\, Vunjak-Nov
 akovic is engineering thick\, vascularized\, and electromechanically funct
 ional cardiac tissue\, by culturing stem cells\, the actual “tissue engi
 neers\,” on a channeled elastomer scaffold perfused with culture medium 
 containing oxygen carriers\, to mimic blood flow. This research may lead t
 o a heart patch that could be laid over injured heart tissue to restore no
 rmal function in someone who has suffered a heart attack.\n\n“As a biome
 dical engineer actively involved in this field\, I look forward to unlocki
 ng the full regenerative potential of human stem cells\, so we can cure di
 sease and live longer than our failing organs\,” she said.\n\nHer lab ho
 sts the Bioreactor Core of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Tissue 
 Engineering Resource Center. “This sophisticated bioreactor and imaging 
 instrumentation has moved stem cell research from the ‘flat biology’ o
 f petri dishes to controllable models of high biological fidelity\, which 
 can be studied in real time to observe the interacting factors mediating s
 elf-renewal and differentiation of stem cells\,” said Vunjak-Novakovic. 
 “We now have the capacity to develop entirely new research paradigms and
  approaches to engineering human tissues.”\n\nIn 2002\, Vunjak-Novakovic
  was elected a fellow of the American Institute for Medical and Biological
  Engineering. In 2007\, she gave the Director’s lecture at the NIH\, as 
 the first woman engineer to receive this distinction. She was inducted int
 o the Women in Technology International Hall of Fame in 2008\, elected to 
 the New York Academy of Sciences in 2009\, and\, in 2010\, received the Cl
 emson Award of the Biomaterials Society for contribution to literature.\n\

DESCRIPTION:Intended audience: Faculty/Staff\, Graduate students\, Postdoc
 \, Undergraduate students\nStatus: draft\n\nThe build up of stress has con
 sequences for the mind and body. Poor sleep\, lack of appetite\, decreased
  productivity\, decreased immunity\, susceptibility to sickness\, are some
  of the few\, and we might find it difficult to get out of the vicious cyc
 le of stress. Except\, nowadays there are some very simple and effective w
 ays to nip the stress bud so we can prevent the over-growth! Come\, join\,
  and learn and try "Tapping" - a simple stress management method to add to
  your tool box. A brief introduction (and actually doing it) is all you ne
 ed so we can better Tap into calm. When: Noon ~ 12:30\, most Fridays start
 ing August 28.\nWhere: Drop In Zoom (Initial download/setup likely require
 d for phone/computer) [01]\nWhat: 1. "Tapping" similar to this video " Tra
 uma Tapping Technique [02]."\n2. Chat and Q&A (Please feel free to leave e
 arly after Tapping\, as needed\, or you are more than welcome to stay a li
 ttle longer and enjoy a Q&A and some more chat.)\n\n- Mental Health Resour

 .\, MDiv [09]\n- Video: " How to Make Stress Your Friend [10] " by Psychol
 ogist Kelly McGonigal\n".... the harmful effects of stress on your health 
 are not inevitable. How you think and how you act can transform your exper
 ience of stress. When you choose to view your stress response as helpful\,
  you create the biology of courage. And when you choose to connect with ot
 hers under stress\, you can create resilience....Stress gives us access to
  our hearts. The compassionate heart that finds joy and meaning in connect
 ing with others\, and yes\, your pounding physical heart\, working so hard
  to give you strength and energy. And when you choose to view stress in th
 is way\, you're not just getting better at stress\, you're actually making
  a pretty profound statement. You're saying that you can trust yourself to
  handle life's challenges. And you're remembering that you don't have to f
 ace them alone. "\n- Video: " First Aid for Emotional Distress - Trauma Ta

 self-help technique to be shared may provide you with some ways to calm do
 wn stress and other emotions. However\, it is not a treatment or prescript
 ion for any medial or mental health issues\, nor a substitute for regular 
 medical or psychological care. If you have a medical or psychological cond
 ition\, please consult your doctor or other appropriate licensed health pr
 actitioner. Joining the Tapping session does not constitute a professional
  relationship between the viewers and the presenters. Choosing to Tap alon
 g means you are taking responsibility for your own self. We hope the sessi
 on will contain some helpful information to you. The following EFT Tapping
