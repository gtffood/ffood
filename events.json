When analyzing graphs, it is often useful to compute scores describing the relative importance or distance between nodes. One example is Personalized PageRank (PPR), which assigns to each node v a vector whose i-th entry describes the importance of the i-th node from the perspective of v. PPR has proven useful in many applications, such as recommending who users should follow on social networks (if this i-th entry is large, v may be interested in following the i-th user). Unfortunately, computing n PPR vectors exactly for a graph of n nodes has complexity O(n^3), which is infeasible for many graphs of interest.\n\nIn this work, we devise a scheme to estimate all n PPR vectors with bounded l1 error and complexity O(n^c), where c< 2 depends on the degrees of the graph at hand, the desired error tolerance, and a parameter that defines PPR. This improves upon existing methods, the best of which have complexity O(n^2 log n) in our setting. Our complexity guarantee holds with high probability, for certain choices of the PPR parameter, and for a certain class of random graphs (roughly speaking, the sparse directed configuration model with heavy-tailed in-degrees); our accuracy guarantee holds with probability 1 and for arbitrary graphs and PPR parameters. The complexity result arises as a consequence of our main (structural) result, which shows that the dimensionality of the set of PPR vectors scales sublinearly in n with high probability, for the same class of random graphs and for a notion of dimensionality similar to matrix rank. It is this coupling of the PPR vectors for the nodes on a common underlying graph that allows for estimating them faster. Hence, at a high level, our scheme is analogous to (but distinct from) low-rank matrix approximation. We also note that our scheme is similar to one that was proposed in Jeh and Widom (2003) but lacked accuracy and complexity guarantees, so another contribution of our paper is to address this gap in the literature.\n\nThis is joint work with Daniel Vial, Univ. of Michigan.\n\nBIO\n\nVijay Subramanian is an Associate Professor in the EECS Department at the University of Michigan. His main research interests are in stochastic modeling, communications, information theory, and applied mathematics. A large portion of his past work has been on probabilistic analysis of communication networks, especially the analysis of scheduling and routing algorithms. In the past, he has also done some work with applications in immunology and coding of stochastic processes. His current research interests are on random graphs, game-theoretic and economic modeling of socio-technological systems and networks, and the analysis of associated stochastic processes.", "links": [], "audience": null, "status": null}, {"crawler": "career.gatech.edu", "url": "https://career.gatech.edu/employer-information-sessions#0", "alternativeUrls": [], "title": "AIG Technology Full Time and Summer Internship Information Session", "start": "2019-10-02T17:30:00-04:00", "end": null, "location": "Bill Moore Student Success Center", "extras": null, "description": "Please join AIG technology managers and analysts to learn about our Technology Summer Internship and Full Time opportunities!

In addition, there has been growing interest in exploiting metal catalyst reactivity to mediate a series of operations, as these can potentially allow the spontaneous build-up of complex compounds in a single operation. Our lab has been actively exploring a number of these concepts, with the general goal of designing efficient synthetic routes of products directly from feedstock reagents. A feature of many these transformations is the use of the readily available small molecule, carbon monoxide, as a tool to drive the energy efficient formation of products that are themselves reactive (acid chlorides, 1,3-dipoles), and undergo subsequent, spontaneous transformations. This talk will describe our development of these transformations, their application to the modular generation of pharmaceutical cores, super electrophiles, new classes of polymers, or the design of alternative catalytic bond forming reactions, as well as the use of external factors such as light to drive their catalytic formation.

Why is this happening? What is the unique value proposition of edge computing? As real-world deployments of edge computing appear, how will the lives of end users be improved? What new applications and capabilities will they see? Which applications run best at the edge, which run best in the cloud, and which should straddle the edge and cloud? How do we build systems that are seamless to the user but leverage all the available tiers of computing to best effect? Based on my team\u2019s decade-long exploration of edge computing, I will share my insights on these questions. Of particular interest is a new class of \u201cwearable cognitive assistance\u201d applications that lie at the convergence of edge computing, wearable devices, and cognitive algorithms (e.g. computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing). Drawing upon insights from these edge-native applications, I will explore what hardware and software infrastructure is needed for edge computing.\n\nBIO:\n\nSatya\u2019s multi-decade research career has focused on the challenges of performance, scalability, availability, and trust in information systems that reach from the cloud to the mobile edge of the internet. In the course of this work, he has pioneered many advances in distributed systems, mobile computing, pervasive computing, and the internet of things (IoT). As described in How we created edge computing, Satya\u2019s seminal 2009 publication The Case for VM-based Cloudlets in Mobile Computing, and the ensuing research has led to the emergence of edge computing (also known as fog computing).

While the superpowers never engaged directly in full-scale\n\narmed combat, a nuclear arms race became the centerpiece of a doctrine of mutually assured\n\ndestruction, and prompted a mass production of plutonium, and the designing, building, and\n\ntesting of large numbers of nuclear weapons. In more than 50 years of operation, the Cold War\n\nbattlefields created over 100 metric tons of plutonium, produced tens of thousands of nuclear\n\nwarheads, oversaw more than 1000 detonations, and left behind a legacy of contaminated\n\nfacilities, soils, and ground water.\n\nThe extent of long-term adverse health effects will depend on the mobility of plutonium and\n\nother actinides in the environment and on our ability to develop cost-effective scientific\n\nmethods of removing or isolating actinides from the environment. Studying the complex\n\nchemistry of plutonium and the actinides in the environment is one of the most important\n\ntechnological challenges, and one of the greatest scientific challenges in actinide science today.1\n\nI will summarize our current understanding of actinide chemistry in the environment, and how\n\nthat understanding was used in the decontamination and decommissioning of the Rocky Flats\n\nSite, where plutonium triggers for U.S. nuclear weapons were manufactured. At Rocky Flats,\n\nsynchrotron radiation measurements made at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory\n\nwere developed into a science-based decision-making tool that saved billions of dollars by\n\nfocusing Site-directed efforts in the correct areas, and aided the most extensive cleanup in the\n\nhistory of Superfund legislation to finish one year ahead of schedule, ultimately resulting in\n\nbillions of dollars in taxpayer savings.2\n\nFigure.

Those of greatest interest to us are ones that spontaneously assemble into organized and/or densely packed solid structures starting from the solution phase or whose structures can be thermodynamically or kinetically transformed. What are the multiscale relationships between the dynamics and products of material formation and transformation and the emergent electronic properties of these materials? How does disorder, as an inherent byproduct of the assembly process, affect these properties both locally and macroscopically?\n\nTo answer these questions I will provide examples of our work to elucidate the mechanisms for ultrafast photoinduced energy transport and for the slower dynamics of material transformations in a wide range of emerging, heterogeneous electronic materials.

Nonetheless, our understanding of how these components are assembled to generate precision physiological systems remains far less developed. To approach this problem, we and others have been using synthetic biology methods to empirically explore how molecular components can be used to construct novel cellular functions. Using these approaches, we have shown that we can reprogram living cellular machines that carryout new novel precision functions, including therapeutic immune cells that precisely recognize and eliminate cancer cells, or cells that self-organize into tissues. By merging our understanding of cellular machines with our knowledge of our bodies and its diseases, we envision the development of a mature field of cell engineering with a toolbox of optimized molecular parts and circuit architectures, as well as disease and \"GPS\" sensors that allow the cell to target specific sites in the body or brain. Such a platform will allow us to rapidly and flexibly prototype and design cells that can identify sites of disease or degeneration and execute precisely targeted and controlled therapeutic actions.\n\nBiography\nWendell Lim is the Byers Distinguished Professor and Chair of the Department of Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology at the University of California San Francisco, and an Investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. He received his A.B. in Chemistry, summa cum laude, from Harvard College, his Ph.D. in Biochemistry and Biophysics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and completed his postdoctoral training at Yale University. His research focuses on the design principles of molecular circuits that govern cell decision-making and responses. His lab has made contributions in understanding the molecular machinery of cell signaling and how molecular modules have been used in evolution to build novel new behaviors. Most recently he has been a pioneer in the emerging field of synthetic biology, exploring how these design principles can be harnessed to engineer cells with customized therapeutic response programs. He is an author of the textbook, Cell Signaling (Garland Science 2014) and was the founder of the cell therapy biotech startup, Cell Design Labs, which was acquired by Gilead Biosciences in 2017.\n\nA community lunch will be served immediately following the presentation.", "links": ["http://calendar.yahoo.com/?v=60&TITLE=Petit%20Institute%20Distinguished%20Lecture&ST=20191022T110000&DUR=0200&URL=www.bme.gatech.edu&in_loc=Parker%20H.%20Petit%20Institute%20for%20Bioengineering%20and%20Bioscience%2C%20Atrium", "https://www.bme.gatech.edu/bme/node/12048/field_event_dates/addtocal.ics", "http://cancer.ucsf.edu/people/profiles/lim_wendell.4798", "http://www.google.com/calendar/event?action=TEMPLATE&text=Petit%20Institute%20Distinguished%20Lecture&dates=20191022T150000Z/20191022T170000Z&sprop=website%3Awww.bme.gatech.edu&location=Parker%20H.%20Petit%20Institute%20for%20Bioengineering%20and%20Bioscience%2C%20Atrium&details=&website=https%3A//www.bme.gatech.edu/bme/petit-institute-distinguished-lecture", "colly.mitchell@ibb.gatech.edu", "http://petitinstitute.gatech.edu/"], "audience": null, "status": null}, {"crawler": "cc.gatech.edu", "url": "https://www.cc.gatech.edu/calendar/day/2019/10/23/14883", "alternativeUrls": [], "title": "OMSCS Wednesday Webinar: Financial Planning", "start": "2019-10-23T12:00:00-04:00", "end": "2019-10-23T13:00:00-04:00", "location": "Online", "extras": null, "description": "Register here.

Over the years, the size and complexity of software have grown as well as the need for fast-changing codebases, fault detection strategies, and test case generation and selection. To meet these challenges, techniques such as regression testing, selection/prioritization, and fault localization have been developed as well as specialized testing techniques for GUIs, object-oriented software, mobile computing, and continuous evolution of software to name a few. This talk presents an overview of these challenges and solutions and references Mary Jean Harrold\u2019s achievements in these areas. The talk then explores current challenges and opportunities that bring problems that cannot be solved by state of art techniques, including applications that are machine learning applications or use machine learning as part of a system where components interact and evolve. Other challenges that need to be explored involve autonomous systems, cloud applications, and data churn. As software becomes more autonomous, its operations and outputs become less predictable at test writing time; hence, the traditional nature of assert (Actual, Expected) test oracles does not work and needs to be addressed.\n\nBIO:\n\nMary Lou Soffa is the Owen R.

Thus, polymeric materials that are capable of stabilizing biomolecules at room temperature and to agitation are of significant interest. This talk will focus on new polymeric materials to address this important problem. Well-defined polymers were synthesized by controlled radical polymerization and ring opening polymerizations. These were tested in their ability to stabilize proteins to room temperature, elevated temperatures, mechanical agitation, and pH changes when added as excipients. Side chains derived from Nature and others from known excipient classes were compared and contrasted, and the mechanisms of stabilization were investigated. Grafting to and grafting from synthetic strategies were utilized to prepare protein conjugates of these polymers, and in vivo testing showed that the polymers significantly increased blood circulation times (i.e. pharmacokinetics) in addition to retaining protein activity after exposure to high temperatures. Furthermore, by altering the synthesis, the polymers could be made responsive in order to release protein drugs on demand. Synthesis, stabilization properties, and application of the polymers in medicine will be presented.", "links": ["http://www.chem.ucla.edu/dept/Faculty/maynard/"], "audience": null, "status": null}, {"crawler": "cc.gatech.edu", "url": "https://www.cc.gatech.edu/calendar/day/2019/11/20/14879", "alternativeUrls": [], "title": "OMSCS Wednesday Webinar: International Job Searching", "start": "2019-11-20T12:00:00-05:00", "end": "2019-11-20T13:00:00-05:00", "location": "Online", "extras": null, "description": "Register here.

In bacterial pathogens, metalloregulation of transcription drives physiological adaptation to host-mediated transition metal starvation and toxicity, required to maintain metal homeostasis. We are currently working on two separate aspects of this problem. In the first, we are employing global multi- \u2018omics strategies to elucidate metabolic adaptation to host-mediated transition metal starvation. In the second, we are employing advanced NMR approaches to understand transition metal sensing at the physicochemical level. In bacterial zinc (Zn) homeostasis, for example, a pair of metal-sensing transcriptional repressors regulate the transcription of metal uptake and efflux transporters, where Zn allosterically activates or inhibits DNA operator-promoter binding. I will present the results of recent comprehensive NMR-based investigations of metal-mediated allostery in a number of metal-sensing transcriptional repressors. Repressor systems selected for study are representative of large bacterial repressor superfamilies, including the arsenic repressor (ArsR) and multiple antibiotic resistance repressor (MarR)-family proteins, and thus provide an opportunity to elucidate general features of metal sensing, inducer specificity and evolution of distinct biological outputs that function at the host-microbial pathogen interface.
